This format is\nHaskell-readable (and only partially human-readable)\nline-by-line. Generating additional training data is therefor\neasy as one can just \"cat\" together different training files.\n\nNote that several features are designed around /extended/ RNA\nsecondary structures.\n\nNow with some filtering and manipulation options.";
