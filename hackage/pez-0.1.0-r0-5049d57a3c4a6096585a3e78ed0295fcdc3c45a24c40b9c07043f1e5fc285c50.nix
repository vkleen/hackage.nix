The zipper is restricted to\ntypes in the 'Typeable' class, allowing the user to \\\"move up\\\" through complex data\nstructures such as mutually-recursive types.\n\nBoth the Typeable class and fclabels lenses can be derived in GHC, making it\neasy for the programmer to use a zipper with a minimum of boilerplate.\n\nPlease send any feature requests or bug reports along.\n\nChanges 0.0.4 -> 0.1.0:\n\n>  - use fclabels 1.0\n>  - module renamed Data.Label.Zipper\n>  - 'ZPath' renamed 'Motion', define new Up type and instance\n>  - fclabels lenses now require wrapping with 'to'\n>  - 'moveTo' changed to 'move'\n>  - savedLens renamed flatten\n>  - SavedPath renamed To\n>  - removed experimental operators\n>  - using failure package for exceptions\n>  - etc., etc.\n";
