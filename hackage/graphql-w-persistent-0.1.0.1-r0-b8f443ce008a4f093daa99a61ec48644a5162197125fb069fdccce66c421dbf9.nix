The query parser and interpreter are universal (on available query types). It is accepting any string query, and it is returning a list of string database-queries. The data processing unit is designed around the return values from the Yesod and Persistent interface (cast as Text data values from PersistValue). With another server that is same data representation on the returned values from the database, this entire package is applicable.
