      description = "Semi-isomorphisms are partial isomorphisms with weakened iso laws. They are a basic\nbuilding block of reversible computations. And they work with Iso and Prism from @lens@!\n\nThe module \"Control.Lens.SemiIso\" defines semi-isomorphisms and provides some\nbasic semi-isos and combinators. A @SemiIso' a b@ can be applied in both directions\nto get a @a -> Either String b@ and @b -> Either String a@. SemiIsos can be composed\nwith Isos and Prisms (to get another SemiIso). Isos and Prisms can be directly\nused as SemiIsos.\n\nSemi-isomorphisms obey weaker laws then isomorphisms. We require only\n\n> apply f >=> unapply f >=> apply f = apply f\n> unapply f >=> apply f >=> unapply f = unapply f\n\ninstead of\n\n> apply f >=> unapply f = f\n> unapply f >=> apply f = f\n\nModules \"Control.SIArrow\" and \"Control.Category.Structures\" define an @Arrow@-like class\nhierarchy. Unfortunately \"Control.Arrow\" cannot be used, as it is too restrictive (the\ndreaded @arr@).\nSIArrow abstracts categories of reversible computations (with reversible side effects). In\nthe case of parsing and pretty-printing using the \"syntax\" library if we have an arrow\n@SIArrow cat => cat a b@ then we can:\n\n* Evaluate it from left to right, turning a value of type @a@ into a value of type @b@,\nwith the side effect of consuming a sequence. (Parsing)\n\n* Evaluate it from right to left, turning a value of type @b@ into a value of type @a@,\nwith the side effect of generating a sequence. (Pretty-printing)\n\nIn the particular case of parsing/pretty-printing the type @a@ will be usually @()@, e.g.\nwe just produce a value during parsing and just consume a value during pretty-printing.\nTo support this style we define a functor and applicative structure on @cat () b@, for example\n'/*/' (equivalent of '<*>') has type @(\\/*\\/) :: SIArrow cat => cat () a -> cat () b -> cat () (a, b)@.\n\nWhen more power then applicative is needed - for example when the syntax depends on the\nparsed value - we turn back to arrow composition.\n\nModule \"Control.Category.Reader\" defines a Reader category transformer. It is like a monad\ntransformer, but for categories. The next version will include some more transformers and\nmtl-style classes.";
