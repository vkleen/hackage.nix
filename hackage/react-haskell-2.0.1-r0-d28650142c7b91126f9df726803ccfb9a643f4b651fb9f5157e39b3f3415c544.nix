React (and React-Haskell) is focused on just UI - it's not a framework.\n\nCurrently React-Haskell can render simple stateful components, but not what React calls classes. Put another way, React-Haskell doesn't support lifecycle methods yet.\n\nHere's a simple example which demonstrates basic elements, attributes, state, and handling events.\n\n> page_ :: ReactNode Void\n> page_ =\n>     let cls = smartClass\n>             -- this is a record and these should really be curly braces,\n>             -- but haddock breaks on them.\n>             [ name = \"page\"\n>\n>             -- initially the input is empty\n>             , initialState = \"\"\n>\n>             -- always transition to the input's new value\n>             , transition = \\(_, value) -> (value, Nothing)\n>\n>             , renderFn = \\_ str -> div_ [ class_ \"container\" ] \$ do\n>                 input_ [ value_ str, onChange (Just . value . target) ]\n>             ]\n>     in classLeaf cls ()\n>\n> main :: IO ()\n> main = do\n>     Just doc <- currentDocument\n>     Just elem <- documentGetElementById doc (\"elem\" :: JSString)\n>     render page_ elem";
