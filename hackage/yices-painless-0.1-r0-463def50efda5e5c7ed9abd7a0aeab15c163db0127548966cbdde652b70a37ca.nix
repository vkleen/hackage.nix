Yices also does\nMaxSMT (and, dually, unsat cores) and is competitive as an ordinary\nSAT and MaxSAT solver.\n\nThe embedded language embeds both terms and types into Haskell, via\na typed higher-order abstract syntax representation. Propositions in\nthe embedding are represented as (typed) pure expressions.\n\nSolution variables in the proposition (notionally, free variables)\nare bound an the outermost lambda term. Propositions constructed\nfrom logical primitives can then be executed by the solver to yield\na satisfying assignment to those free variables in the proposition.\n\nMore information about Yices:\n\n* <http://yices.csl.sri.com/>\n\nLow and medium-level bindings to the Yices C API are also provided.\nThe medium-level bindings add significant type and resource safety\nto that which the C API provides.";
