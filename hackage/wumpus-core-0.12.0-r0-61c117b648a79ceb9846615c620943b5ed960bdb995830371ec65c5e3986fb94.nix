      description = "Wumpus - (W)riter (M)onad (P)ost (S)cript.\n\nWumpus is a library for generating 2D vector pictures, its\nsalient feature is portability due to no FFI dependencies.\nIt can generate PostScript (EPS) files and SVG files. The\ngenerated PostScript code is quite efficient (no unnecessary\nstack operations) and plain [1].\n\nPictures in Wumpus are made from /paths/ and text /labels/.\nPaths themselves are made from points. The usual affine\ntransformations (rotations, scaling, translations) can be\napplied to all geometric objects. Unlike PostScript there\nis no notion of a current point, Wumpus builds pictures in a\ncoordinate-free style. There is a set of combinators for\ncomposing pictures (more-or-less similar to the usual pretty\nprinting combinators).\n\nTHE DRAWBACKS...\n\nFor actually drawing pictures, diagrams, etc. Wumpus is very\nlow level. I am working on a complementary package\n@wumpus-extra@ with higher-level stuff (polygons, arrows etc.)\nbut it is far too unstable for Hackage. Preview releases can be\nfound at http://code.google.com/p/copperbox/ though.\n\nWumpus-core should be fairly stable from now on, except for\nthe fact that more modules are exposed than strictly necessary\nthis is so their Haddock docs are available. Client\\'s should\nonly import the @Wumpus.Core@ module. There may be some name\nchanges etc. that will change interfaces, but Wumpus has\nbeen carefully implemented. Some of the design decisions are\nnot sophisticated (e.g. how attributes like colour are handled,\nand the bounding boxes of text labels are calculated), so\nWumpus might be limited compared to other systems but its\ndesign permits a simple implementation - which is a priority.\nText encoding is the exception, the current implementation\nappears reasonable for Latin 1 but I\\'m not sure about other\ncharacter sets, and I might have to revise it significantly.\n\n/There is no documentation/ - the graphics model used by\nWumpus is different to PostScript or SVG, and Wumpus really\nneeds a manual. Unfortunately there isn\\'t one yet, and I will\nbe focusing on @wumpus-extra@ for the foreseeable future so a\nmanual won\\'t be written soon. If you want FFI-free vector\ngraphics and Wumpus seems to otherwise fit the task, please\nemail me and I will try to help.\n\n\\[1\\] Because the output is simple, straight-line PostScript\ncode it is possible to use GraphicsMagick or similar tools to\nconvert Wumpus'\\s EPS files to many other formats (bitmaps).";
