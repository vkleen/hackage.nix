The arithmetic supports also anti-consistent\nintervals (ie @[l,r]@ with @l >= r@) and maintains monotonicity in the\nrefinement order so that both inner and outer approximations of exact interval\nexpressions can be safely computed.\n\nThe package AERN-Real-Double makes it possible to use ordinary\nmachine 'Double' values as endpoints, although limited to its fixed granularity (ie precision).\n\nA package AERN-Real-MPFR will be provided in future to facilitate (via package hmpfr)\nthe use of the MPFR arbitrary granularity (ie precision) floating point numbers\nas endpoints.\n\nThis package does not compile with ghc 7.0.* due to a\ncompiler bug that has been fixed for the 7.2.1 release.\nHaddock documentation can be found via <http://code.google.com/p/aern/wiki/Main>.";
