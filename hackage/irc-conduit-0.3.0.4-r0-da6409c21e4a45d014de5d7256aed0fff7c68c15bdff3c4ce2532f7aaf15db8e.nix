This package takes it a little further, providing an ADT\nfor IRC messages and sources, and conduits which attempt to decode\nand encode messages appropriately.\n\nIn addition to providing conduits for automatically handling\nstreaming messages, there are also helper functions for connecting\nto an IRC server and hooking up conduits to the socket.";
