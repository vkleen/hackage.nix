      description = "A library providing tools for building enumeration procedures for recursively-\nenumerable datatypes.  This is built atop the arith-encode library, and makes\nuse of the natural number isomorphisms it provides to represent individual\ndecisions in the enumeration procedure.  As such, each enumeration result is\ndenoted by a unique path, consisting of a sequence of natural numbers.  An\nenumeration procedure is simply a (partial) mapping between sequences\nand a given datatype.\n\nThe library provides functionality for constructing enumeration procedures,\nas well as facilities for performing enumeration according to various search\nstrategies (depth-first, breadth-first, etc).  These procedures can also be\n\"warm-started\" using a path or a set of paths.  Obvious applications include\nexhaustive search, testing, automated proving, and others.\n\nAdditionally, as a path is simply a sequence of natural numbers, an\nenumeration procedure can double as a binary serializer/deserializer.  For\nwell-behaved enumeration procedures (ie. those where the mapping is an\nisomorphism), the resulting binary format should be very nearly succinct.\n\nThis is the first release candidate for 1.0 (initial release)";
