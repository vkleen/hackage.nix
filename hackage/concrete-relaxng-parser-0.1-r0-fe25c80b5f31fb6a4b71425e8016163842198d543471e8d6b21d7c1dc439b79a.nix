The input must be well-formed XML. The output of the parser is either an\nerror or XML conforming to the schema.\n\nIf the input XML already conforms to the target schema, the parser acts as an ordinary RELAX NG validator. If not, it\nattempts to insert the missing element tags and to parse the text nodes within the input XML into XML elements. The\ntarget schema can be enriched by concrete syntax extensions, syntactically compatible with standard RELAX NG, to drive\nthe parsing process.\n\nThe included sample RELAX NG schema @xhtml-concrete.rng@ is an extension of the regular must be used together with\nJames Clark's modularized RELAX NG schema for XHTML, which can be downloaded from\n<http://www.thaiopensource.com/relaxng/xhtml/>.
