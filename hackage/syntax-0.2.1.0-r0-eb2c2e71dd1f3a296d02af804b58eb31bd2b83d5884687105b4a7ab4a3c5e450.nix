You fmap using\na semi-isomorphism instead of function. A semi-isomorphism is a isomorphism that can fail in both directions, with slightly\nweakened laws. It is worth to note that @Iso@s and @Prism@s from 'lens' are valid semi-isomorphisms :)\n\nOnce you write a description you can, for example turn it into an Attoparsec parser.\n\nSee @syntax-example@ for an example, 'syntax-attoparsec' and 'syntax-pretty' for a parser/printer implementation.\n\nThe library was inspired by:\n\n* Rendel, Tillmann, and Klaus Ostermann. \"Invertible syntax descriptions: unifying parsing and pretty printing.\" ACM Sigplan Notices. Vol. 45. No. 11. ACM, 2010.\n\nTODO:\n\n* a printer library based on Text/ByteString builders (wrapping 'pretty' is inefficient and doesn't use any features of it),\n\n* try to implement indentation and Haskell layout rule,\n\n* combinators for binary data formats, vectors,\n\n* implementation of do notation for SemiIsoMonad with QuasiQuoters.";
