The\nlibrary works for parallelising both pure and @IO@ computations,\nalthough only the pure version is deterministic.  The default\nimplementation provides a work-stealing scheduler and supports\nforking tasks that are much lighter weight than IO-threads.\n\nFor complete documentation see \"Control.Monad.Par\".\n\nSome examples of use can be found in the @examples/@ directory of\nthe source package.\n\nOther related packages:\n\n* @abstract-par@ provides the type classes that abstract over different\nimplementations of the @Par@ monad.\n\n* @monad-par-extras@ provides extra combinators and monad transformers layered on top of\nthe @Par@ monad.\n\nChanges in 0.3.4 relative to 0.3:\n\n* Fix bugs that cause \"thread blocked indefinitely on MVar\" crashes.\n\n* Added \"Control.Monad.Par.IO\"";
