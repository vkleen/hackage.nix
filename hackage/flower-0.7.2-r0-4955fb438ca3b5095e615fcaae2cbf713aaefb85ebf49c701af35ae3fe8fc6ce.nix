By default,\nit outputs a textual representation of the data in the SFF-file, much like\n'sffinfo' from Roche does.\n\nThe flowselect executable extracts reads from SFF-files, generating a new\nSFF-file with a subset of the reads based on various quality criteria.\n\nThe flowt program removes (artificial) duplicates from SFF files.  It's currently a work\nin progress, but included if you'd like to play with it.  It's faster than other approaches\n(e.g. CD-HIT), and ought to be more sensitive and specific, but this needs to be proven.";
