Clients connect to a\ngroup of Memcached servers and perform out-of-band caching for things like\nSQL results, rendered pages, or third-party APIs.\n\nIt supports the binary Memcached protocol and SASL authentication. No support\nfor the ASCII protocol is provided. It supports connecting to a single, or a\ncluster of Memcached servers. When connecting to a cluser, consistent hashing\nis used for routing requests to the appropriate server. Timeouts, retrying\nfailed operations, and failover to a different server are all supported.\n\nComplete coverage of the Memcached protocol is provided except for multi-get\nand other pipelined operations.\n\nBasic usage is:\n\n> import qualified Database.Memcache.Client as M\n>\n> mc <- M.newClient [M.ServerSpec \"localhost\" 11211 M.NoAuth] M.def\n> M.set mc \"key\" \"value\" 0 0\n> v <- M.get mc \"key\"\n\nYou should only need to import 'Database.Memcache.Client', but for now other\nmodules are exposed.";
