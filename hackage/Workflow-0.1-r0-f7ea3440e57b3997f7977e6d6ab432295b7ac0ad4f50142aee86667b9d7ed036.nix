Workflow give the two first services to any monadic computation of type  (a-> m a)\nf x >>=\\x'-> g x' >>= \\x''->... z by\nprefixing the user with the method \"step\":\nstep f  x >>= \\x'-> step g  x' >>= \\x''->...\nThis means that a workflow can be described with the familiar \"do\" notation. In principle, there is no other limitation\non the syntax but the restriction (a -> m a): All computations consume and produce the same type of data.\nfor a monadic computation, Workflow provides:\n- transparent checkpointing for each step in permanent storage (using TCache)\n- resume of the monadic computation at the last checkpoint after soft or hard interruption\n- use of versioning techniques for storing object changes (using RefSerialize)\n- retrieval of the object at any previous step\n- suspend the computation until the input object meet certain conditions. useful for inter-workflow\ncomunications.\nFor various reasons, this package force the use of TCache for storage and refSerialize for writing to/from strings\nat the end of the workflow all the intermediate data is erased.\nsee demo.hs and the header of Control.TCache for documentation.";
