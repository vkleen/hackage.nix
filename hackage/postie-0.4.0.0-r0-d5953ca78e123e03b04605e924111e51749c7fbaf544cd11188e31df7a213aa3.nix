It is currently\nin a very early stage and not yet fully standard compatible although the standard\nprotocol is already supported.\n\n* At the time of writing parameters on smtp commands can not be parsed.\n\n* Handler functions need to return more detailed information to cancel a transaction.\n\n`postie` supportes hooks on key commands in an smtp session like\n\n* on connection open and close\n\n* on /MAIL FROM/ command e.g. to intercept transaction if sender is blacklisted\n\n* on /RCPT TO/ command e.g. to check if recipient is existent on your server\n\n* and many more\n\nTo run `postie` you only need to supply a function which takes a `Mail` and\nreturn `Accepted` or `Rejected`. `mailBody` is a `pipes` `Producer` which\nstreams the encoded body directly to your application code. The body is not\nparsed by `postie` since it depends on what the application wants to do with\nthe mail data. Eventually I will create a seperate package for parsing mime\nmessages with `pipes-parse` when postie becomes more stable and standard compliant.";
