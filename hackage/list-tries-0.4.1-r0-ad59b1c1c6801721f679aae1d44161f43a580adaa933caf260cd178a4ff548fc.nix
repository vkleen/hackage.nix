Child maps are required to be\ninstances of the Map class in Data.ListTrie.Base.Map. Some operations\nadditionally require an OrdMap instance.\n\nThe Eq, Ord, and Enum modules contain ready structures for key types which\nare instances of those classes, using lists of pairs, Data.Map, and\nData.IntMap respectively.";
