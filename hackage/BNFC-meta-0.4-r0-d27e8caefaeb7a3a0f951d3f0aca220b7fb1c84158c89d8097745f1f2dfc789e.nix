      description = "This package provides a very simple way of defining a compiler\nfront-end for a language by embedding a BNF grammar directly into a Haskell\nsource file.\nSpecifically, given a quasi-quoted LBNF grammar (as used by the BNF Converter)\nit generates (using Template Haskell) a LALR parser and pretty pretty printer\nfor the language. The parser is then used to automatically define a\nquasi-quoter for the defined language so it can also be seamlessly embedded\nin Haskell source code. With a\nsimple addition to the grammar, the user can define a universal syntax for\nanti-quoting. This\nmeans that any grammar non-terminal can be replaced by a quoted Haskell\nexpression of the appropriate type. A few example languages are included in\nthe source tarball.\n\nThe LBNF grammar formalism is described thoroughly in the BNF Converter\ndocumentation: <http://bnfc.digitalgrammars.com/>\n\nThis library and the additions it makes to LBNF is described in a\n2011 Haskell Symposium paper titled \\\"Embedded Parser Generators\\\":\n<http://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/cse/pmwiki.php/FP/EmbeddedParserGenerators>";
