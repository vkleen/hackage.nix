We can swap this context\nby defining a transfer function:\n> idToIO :: Identity b -> IO b\n> idToIO (Identity v) = putStrLn \"Transferring\" *> pure v\nThe context is switched using `transfer` and we can access the value in this\nnew context by using `shadow`:\n> runInIO :: Shade Identity a -> IO a\n> runInIO = shadow . transfer idToIO\nThe point to note about this example is that the values are stored in an\nshades with the identity as context. We can manipulate this context\nincluding the value. We cannot, however inspect the value since it is\nuniversally quantified.";
