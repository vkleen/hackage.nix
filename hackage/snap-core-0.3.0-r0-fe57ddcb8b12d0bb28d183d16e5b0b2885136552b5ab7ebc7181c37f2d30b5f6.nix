For\nmore information or to download the latest version, you can visit the Snap\nproject website at <http://snapframework.com/>.\n\nThis library contains the core definitions and types for the Snap framework,\nincluding:\n\n1. Primitive types and functions for HTTP (requests, responses, cookies,\npost/query parameters, etc)\n\n2. Type aliases and helper functions for Iteratee I/O\n\n3. A monad for programming web handlers called \\\"Snap\\\", inspired by\nhappstack's (<http://happstack.com/index.html>), which allows:\n\n* Stateful access to the HTTP request and response objects\n\n* Monadic failure (i.e. MonadPlus/Alternative instances) for declining\nto handle requests and chaining handlers together\n\n* Early termination of the computation if you know early what you want\nto return and want to prevent further monadic processing\n\n/Quick start/: The 'Snap' monad and HTTP definitions are in \"Snap.Types\",\nsome iteratee utilities are in \"Snap.Iteratee\".\n\nHigher-level facilities for building web applications (like user/session\nmanagement, component interfaces, data modeling, etc.) are planned but not\nyet implemented, so this release will mostly be of interest for those who:\n\n* need a fast and minimal HTTP API at roughly the same level of abstraction\nas Java servlets, or\n\n* are interested in contributing to the Snap Framework project.";
