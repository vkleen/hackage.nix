Currently only tested on Ubuntu Linux, but should work on most linux distributions. For OpenCV installation on other *nix platforms, see <http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/opencv-unix/2.0/>\n\nOn /Ubuntu/ systems, the appropriate version of OpenCV can be installed by:\n\n> sudo apt-get install libcv-dev libhighgui-dev libcvaux-dev\n\nYou should then have libcv4 and libhighgui4 installed automatically too.\n";
