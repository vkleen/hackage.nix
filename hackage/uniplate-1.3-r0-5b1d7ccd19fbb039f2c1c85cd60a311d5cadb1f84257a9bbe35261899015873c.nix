Both the above two modules re-export this module.\n\nIn addition, some users may want to make use of the following modules:\n\n* \"Data.Generics.SYB\" - users transitioning from the Scrap Your Boilerplate library.\n\n* \"Data.Generics.Compos\" - users transitioning from the Compos library.\n\n* \"Data.Generics.Uniplate.DataOnly\" - users making use of both @Data@ and @Direct@\nto avoid getting instance conflicts.";
