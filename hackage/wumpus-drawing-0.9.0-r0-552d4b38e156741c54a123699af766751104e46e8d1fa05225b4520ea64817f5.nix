Although many of\nthe drawing objects have been improved since the code was split\nfrom Wumpus-Basic, the code is still prototypical. Essentially\nthis package is a /technology preview/ and not yet a re-usable\nlibrary.\n\nNOTE - many of the demos use font metrics. Font metrics for\nthe \\\"Core 14\\\" PostScript fonts are distributed as @*.afm@\nfiles with GhostScript in the @fonts@ directory. Wumpus expects\nthe GhostScript font metrics to be AFM version 2.0 files (this\nmatches GhostScript 8.63). Alternatively, metrics for the Core\n14 fonts are available from Adode (AFM version 4.1), see the\nlinks below. To run the demos properly you will need one of\nthese sets of metrics.\n\nAdobe Font technical notes:\n<https://www.adobe.com/devnet/font.html>\n\nCore 14 AFM metrics:\n<https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/font/pdfs/Core14_AFMs.tar>\n\nAlso note that Wumpus uses fallback metrics (derived from the\nmonospaced Courier font) when font loading fails, rather than\nthrowing a terminal error. Applications should ideally check\nthe font loading log to ensure that fonts have loaded correctly\n(the demos print this log to standard out).\n\nChangelog:\n\nv0.8.0 to v0.9.0:\n\n* Updated to work with wumpus-basic-0.24.0.\n\n* Removed monoid mappend alias @(<>)@ as it is now defined by\nData.Monoid.\n\nv0.7.0 to v0.8.0:\n\n* Changed API to make Connectors.\n\n* Added InclineTrails to Drawing.Basis.\n\n* Reworked @Extras.Loop@.\n\nv0.6.0 to v0.7.0:\n\n* Changed paths - @RelPath@ has been removed and there are now\nonly absolute paths. @PathBuilder@ builds absolute paths.\nPen updating in @PathBuilder@ now works like a State monad\nrather than @local@ in a Reader monad.\n\n* Changed argument order of the run functions to @monadLib@\nstyle (params * monadic action) rather than @MTL@ style\n(monadic action * params).\n\n* Added Symbols to Drawing.Basis.\n\n* Added a tube box connector.\n\nv0.5.0 to v0.6.0:\n\n* Removed @LocTrace@ and @RefTrace@ from @Wumpus.Drawing.Basis@,\nthey are superseded by @LocDrawing@ in Wumpus-Basic.\n\n* Remaned path building operations in @RelPathBuilder@.\n\n";
