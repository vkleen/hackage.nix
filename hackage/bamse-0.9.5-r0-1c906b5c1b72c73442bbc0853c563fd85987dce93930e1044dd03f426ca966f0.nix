Bamse is also accessible as a library, letting\nyou integrate MSI creation into your codebase.\n\nThe package has a number of example /templates/ showing how to\nspecify a generator; /real/ examples that have been used to ship\nsoftware by a number of projects and companies. See the @templates/@\ndirectory; one good way to get started is to modify one of these\nto suit the needs of the installers you are looking to create.\n\nFor a worked example of how to build installers from your Cabal packages,\nand possibly automatically install them when running the MSI, see @examples/Cabal.hs@\n(and the README in that directory.)";
