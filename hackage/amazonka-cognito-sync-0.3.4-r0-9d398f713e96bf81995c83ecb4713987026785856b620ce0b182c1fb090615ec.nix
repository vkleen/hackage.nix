You can use Amazon Cognito to obtain a normalized user ID and\ncredentials. User data is persisted in a dataset that can store up to 1 MB of\nkey-value pairs, and you can have up to 20 datasets per user identity.\n\n/See:/ <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognitosync/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html AWS API Reference>\n\n/Warning:/ This is an experimental preview release which is still under\nheavy development and not intended for public consumption, caveat emptor!";
