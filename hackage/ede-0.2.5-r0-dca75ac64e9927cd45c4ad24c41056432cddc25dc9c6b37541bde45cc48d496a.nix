A small set of consistent predicates\nand expressions for formatting and presentational logic are provided.\n\n* Secure. No arbitrary code evaluation, with input data required to be fully specified\nat render time.\n\n* Stateless. Parsing and rendering are separate steps so that loading, parsing,\ninclude resolution, and embedding of the compiled template can optionally be\ndone ahead of time, amortising cost.\n\n* Markup agnostic. ED-E is used to write out everything from configuration files for\nsystem services, to HTML and formatted emails.\n\n* Control over purity. Users can choose pure or IO-based resolution of\n@include@ expressions.\n\n* No surprises. All parsing, type assurances, and rendering steps report helpful\nerror messages with line/column metadata. Variable shadowing, unprintable expressions,\nimplicit type coercion, and unbound variable access are all treated as errors.";
