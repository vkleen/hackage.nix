It is available at\n\n<http://www.bytereef.org/mpdecimal/>\n\nmpdecimal has also been packaged for some Linux distributions,\nsuch as Debian (libmpdec-dev - available in Jessie and later) and\nArch (mpdecimal).\n\nmpdecimal, in turn, implements the General Decimal Arithmetic\nSpecification, which is available at\n\n<http://speleotrove.com/decimal/>\n\nFor more on deka, please see the Github home page at\n\n<https://github.com/massysett/deka>";
