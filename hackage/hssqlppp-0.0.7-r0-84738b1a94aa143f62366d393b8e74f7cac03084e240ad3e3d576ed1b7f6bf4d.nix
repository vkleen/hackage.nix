The loader just about does the job\nbut error handling is a bit crap at the moment.\n\nComes with a HUnit test suite which you can run using the\nHsSqlPppTests executable, and command line access to some\nfunctions via a exe called HsSqlSystem, run this file with no\narguments to get some help. See the project page\n<https://launchpad.net/hssqlppp> for more information and\ndocumentation links.";
