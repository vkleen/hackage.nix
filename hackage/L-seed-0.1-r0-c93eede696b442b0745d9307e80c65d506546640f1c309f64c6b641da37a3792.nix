The players can not change the\ncode of a growing plant, but they do have the chance to update their\ncode for the next generation -- when a plant drops a seed, it will run\nthe newest code. All in all, the game aims to be slowly paced and\nrelaxing, something to just watch for a while and something that does\nnot need constant attention by the players.\n\nThis package contains the haskell programs, i.e. the game simulation\nwith the visual display.
