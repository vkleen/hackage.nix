It provides a purely functional interface for advanced graphics programming, including a type safe embedded DSL for GPU programming. You are not required to know or use OpenGL directly to work with FWGL, you just need a basic knowledge of what vertex/fragment shaders, uniforms and attributes are (if you are going to make a more advanced use of it). FWGL is aimed at functional reactive programming (with Yampa), but provides a non-reactive interface as well. There are two backends: fwgl-glfw and fwgl-javascript.";
