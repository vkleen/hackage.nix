Shape descriptions are statically typed.\n\nSchemas are related by a subtyping relation, which can be used to implement\na simple form of schema versioning. As long as one knows the source and target\nschemas, and the source is a subtype of the target, source values can be encoded\nin the target schema.\n\nThe library also supports @oneOf@ and @allOf@ schemas, which extend the\nrange of versioning changes that can be supported automatically without\nresorting to explicit versions and conversion functions.\n\nA type class @HasSchema@ is provided purely for convenience, but none of the\ncore functions in the library rely on type classes.\n\nSchemas can be derived generically using @generics-sop@, although most of the\ntime it makes more sense to define the schemas explicitly to ensure well-behaved\nversioning.";
