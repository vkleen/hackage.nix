This\ncan be used for SmallCheck-style systematic testing,\nQuickCheck style random testing, and hybrids of the two.\n\nThe enumerators are defined in a very boilerplate manner\nand there is a Template Haskell script for deriving the\nclass instance for most types.\n\"Test.Feat\" contain a subset of the other modules that\nshould be sufficient for most test usage. There\nare some small and large example in the tar\nball.\n\nThe generators are provided by the size-based package. This means other libraries that implement the Sized class can use the same generator definitions. One such is the\n<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/lazy-search lazy-search package>, that uses laziness to search for values and test properties. This is typically a lot faster than Feat for properties that have preconditions (logical implication), but can not be used for random selection of values.";
