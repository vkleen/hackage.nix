It does not keep a copy of\nyour original documents.\n\nIt is independent of the document type, so you have to\nwrite the document-specific parts: extracting search terms\nand any case-normalisation or stemming. This is quite\neasy using libraries such as\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/tokenize tokenize> and\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/snowball snowball>.\n\nFor an example, see the code for the\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hackage-server hackage-server>\nwhere it is used for the package search feature.";
