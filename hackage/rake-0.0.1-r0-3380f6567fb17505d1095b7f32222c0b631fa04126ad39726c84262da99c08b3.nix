(2010):\nAutomatic Keyword Extraction from Individual Documents.\nIn M. W. Berry & J. Kogan (Eds.),\nText Mining: Theory and Applications: John Wiley & Sons,\navailable online at:\n<http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/courses/introduction_to_systems_biology/chapter1_textmining.pdf>.\n\nMore information on this haskell library is available\non <https://github.com/toschoo/Haskell-Libs>.";
