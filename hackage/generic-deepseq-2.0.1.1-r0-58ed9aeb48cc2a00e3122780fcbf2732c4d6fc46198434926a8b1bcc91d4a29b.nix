As a consequence of these changes, the member function of the DeepSeq class is now 'rnf', instead of 'deepseq'.\n\n* New instances for functions, Ratio and Complex types.\n\nChanges in version 2.0.1.0:\n\n* Fix the U1 and V1 instances.\n\nChanges in version 2.0.1.1:\n\n* No functional changes, updated to correct the URLs of the repository and the issue tracker.";
