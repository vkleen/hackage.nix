      description = "@Data.Scientific@ provides the number type 'Scientific'. Scientific numbers are\narbitrary precision and space efficient. They are represented using\n<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_notation scientific notation>.\nThe implementation uses a coefficient @c :: 'Integer'@ and a base-10 exponent\n@e :: 'Int'@. A scientific number corresponds to the\n'Fractional' number: @'fromInteger' c * 10 '^^' e@.\n\nNote that since we're using an 'Int' to represent the exponent these numbers\naren't truly arbitrary precision. I intend to change the type of the exponent\nto 'Integer' in a future release.\n\nThe main application of 'Scientific' is to be used as the target of parsing\narbitrary precision numbers coming from an untrusted source. The advantages\nover using 'Rational' for this are that:\n\n* A 'Scientific' is more efficient to construct. Rational numbers need to be\nconstructed using '%' which has to compute the 'gcd' of the 'numerator' and\n'denominator'.\n\n* 'Scientific' is safe against numbers with huge exponents. For example:\n@1e1000000000 :: 'Rational'@ will fill up all space and crash your\nprogram. Scientific works as expected:\n\n> > read \"1e1000000000\" :: Scientific\n> 1.0e1000000000\n\n* Also, the space usage of converting scientific numbers with huge exponents to\n@'Integral's@ (like: 'Int') or @'RealFloat's@ (like: 'Double' or 'Float')\nwill always be bounded by the target type.";
