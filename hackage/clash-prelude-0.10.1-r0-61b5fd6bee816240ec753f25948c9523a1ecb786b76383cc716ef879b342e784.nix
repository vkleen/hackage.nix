The CλaSH compiler transforms these high-level descriptions to\nlow-level synthesizable VHDL, Verilog, or SystemVerilog.\n\nFeatures of CλaSH:\n\n* Strongly typed (like VHDL), yet with a very high degree of type inference,\nenabling both safe and fast prototying using consise descriptions (like\nVerilog).\n\n* Interactive REPL: load your designs in an interpreter and easily test all\nyour component without needing to setup a test bench.\n\n* Higher-order functions, with type inference, result in designs that are\nfully parametric by default.\n\n* Synchronous sequential circuit design based on streams of values, called\n@Signal@s, lead to natural descriptions of feedback loops.\n\n* Support for multiple clock domains, with type safe clock domain crossing.\n\n\nThis package provides:\n\n* Prelude library containing datatypes and functions for circuit design\n\nTo use the library:\n\n* Import \"CLaSH.Prelude\"\n\n* Additionally import \"CLaSH.Prelude.Explicit\" if you want to design\nexplicitly clocked circuits in a multi-clock setting\n\nA preliminary version of a tutorial can be found in \"CLaSH.Tutorial\", for a\ngeneral overview of the library you should however check out \"CLaSH.Prelude\".\nSome circuit examples can be found in \"CLaSH.Examples\".";
