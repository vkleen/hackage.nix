The ixset package makes use\nof run-time type information to find a suitable index on a query, resulting\nin possible run-time errors when no suitable index exists. In ixset-typed,\nthe types of all indices available or tracked in the type system.\nThus, ixset-typed should be safer to use than ixset, but in turn requires\nmore GHC extensions.\n\nAt the moment, the two packages are relatively compatible. As a consequence\nof the more precise types, a few manual tweaks are necessary when switching\nfrom one to the other, but the interface is mostly the same.";
