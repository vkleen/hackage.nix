The '@p' encoding is used for naming ships; it uniquely\nrepresents a 32-bit number in a memorable and pronounceable fashion.\n\nThe '@p' encoding is an obfuscated representation of an underlying 32-bit\nnumber, in particular, hence the 'ob' in the library's name.\n\nThe library exposes two functions, 'patp' and 'fromPatp', for converting\nbetween representations.  You can render a 'Patp' value via the 'render'\nfunction.\n\nHere's a quick example:\n\n> import qualified Urbit.Ob as Ob\n>\n> let nidsut = Ob.patp 15663360\n> Ob.render nidsut\n\"~nidsut-tomdun\"\n> Ob.fromPatp nidsut\n15663360";
