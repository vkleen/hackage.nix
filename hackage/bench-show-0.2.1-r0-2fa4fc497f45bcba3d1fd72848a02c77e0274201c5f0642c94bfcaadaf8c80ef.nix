In a few lines of code, we can report time taken, peak\nmemory usage, allocations, among many other fields; we can arrange benchmarks\nin groups and compare the groups; we can compare benchmark results before and\nafter a change; we can show the difference from baseline in absolute terms or\nas a percentage; we can sort the results by percentage change to get the\nworst affected benchmarks.\n\n@bench-show@ helps us in answering questions like the following, visually or\ntextually:\n\n* Across two benchmark runs, show all the operations that resulted in a\nregression of more than 10%, so that we can quickly identify and fix\nperformance problems in our application.\n* Across two (or more) packages (providing similar functionality), show all\nthe operations where the performance differs by more than 10%, so that we\ncan critically analyze the packages and choose the right one.\n\nQuick Start: Use @gauge@ or @criterion@ to generate a @results.csv@ file, and\nthen use the following code to generate a textual report or a graph:\n\n@\nreport \"results.csv\"  Nothing defaultConfig\ngraph  \"results.csv\" \"output\" defaultConfig\n@\n\nFor example, you can show can show % regression from a baseline in descending\norder texttually as follows:\n\n@\n(time)(Median)(Diff using min estimator)\nBenchmark streamly(0)(Î¼s)(base) streamly(1)(%)(-base)\n\\--------- --------------------- ---------------------\nzip                      644.33                +23.28\nmap                      653.36                 +7.65\nfold                     639.96                -15.63\n@\n\nTo show the same graphically:\n\n<<src/docs/regression-percent-descending-median-time.svg>>\n\nSee the README and the \"BenchShow.Tutorial\" module for comprehensive\ndocumentation.";
