MRM\nallows the modular definition of datatypes and functions by\npattern matching, using a style similar to the widely popular\nDatatypes a la Carte (DTC) approach. However, unlike DTC, MRM\nuses a fixpoint of list-of-functors approach to two-level types.\nThis approach has advantages that help with various aspects of\nextensibility, modularity and reuse.\nFor more information, please refer to\n<http://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/~scm/2015/mrm/>.";
