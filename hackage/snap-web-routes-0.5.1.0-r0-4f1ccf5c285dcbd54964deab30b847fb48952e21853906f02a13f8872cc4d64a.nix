Also provided are functions to use the URL data type in your app:\n\n> someHandler :: Handler App App ()\n> someHandler :: doSomething >> redirectURL \$ User Index\n\nand to generate URLs in views:\n\n> linksHandler :: Handler App App ()\n> linksHandler = heistLocal (I.bindSplices linksSplices) \$ render \"links\"\n>   where\n>     linksSplices = do\n>         \"loginUrl\" ## urlSplice Login\n";
