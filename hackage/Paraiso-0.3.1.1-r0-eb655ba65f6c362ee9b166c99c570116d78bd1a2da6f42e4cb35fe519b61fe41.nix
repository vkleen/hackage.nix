Reserved words are @load@, @store@, @imm@,\n@loadIndex@, @loadSize@, @shift@, @reduce@ and\n@broadcast@.\n\nParaiso frontend uses \"Data.Tensor.Typelevel\"\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/typelevel-tensor>,\nthe library for tensor calculus of\narbitrary rank and dimension. @Vector@ and @Axis@ are two main\nconcepts. The type @Vector@ represents rank-1 tensor, and tensors\nof higher ranks are recursively defined as @Vector@ of\n@Vector@s. With @Axis@ you can refer to the components of\n@Vector@s, compose them, or contract them.
