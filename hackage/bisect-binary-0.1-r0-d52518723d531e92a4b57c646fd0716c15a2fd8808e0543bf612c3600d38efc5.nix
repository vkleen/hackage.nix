One approach to help you in the process is to erase parts of the file\n(by overwriting it with binary zeros) and see if the file still does what it\nshould be doing. If it does, then you know that the interesting parts are in\nanother part of the file.\n\n`binary-binary` assists in this process by doing the book-keeping and zeroing\nout parts of the file.";
