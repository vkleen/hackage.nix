These libraries provide robust and full-featured Unicode\nservices on a wide variety of platforms.\n\nFeatures include:\n\n* Both pure and impure bindings, to allow for fine control over efficiency\nand ease of use.\n\n* Breaking of strings on character, word, sentence, and line boundaries.\n\n* Access to the Unicode Character Database (UCD) of character metadata.\n\n* String collation functions, for locales where the conventions for\nlexicographic ordering differ from the simple numeric ordering of\ncharacter codes.\n\n* Character set conversion functions, allowing conversion between\nUnicode and over 220 character encodings.\n\n* Unicode normalization.  (When implementations keep strings in a\nnormalized form, they can be assured that equivalent strings have a\nunique binary representation.)\n\n* Regular expression search and replace.";
