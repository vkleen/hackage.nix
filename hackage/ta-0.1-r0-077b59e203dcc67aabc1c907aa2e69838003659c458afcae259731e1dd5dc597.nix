The datatype declaration for the result of a query,\n\n2. The DBM action that run the query and accumulates\nthe result,\n\n3.Optionally, a meta-variable whose value is the former two declarations.\n\nThis initial version has the following benefits:\n\n- TA contains code to test if your program will fail before it runs, based\non comparing the original generated code versus a fresh\nversion of generated code,\n\n- The user can code queries with more than eight columns length,\n\n- The code generator process is aware if the column can be null,\nand generate the appropiate code.\n\nSome TA drawbacks at this point are:\n\n- The user only can specify queries, that is, select statements.\n\n- The select specification is awkward.\n\n- The select specification is a list. You can specify one or many\nunder a sole name.\n- You can bind parameters or not (by means of [[]]).\n\n- Functions names and constructors are named in spanish.";
