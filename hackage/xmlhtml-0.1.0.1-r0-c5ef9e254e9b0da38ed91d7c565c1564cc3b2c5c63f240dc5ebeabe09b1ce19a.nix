Rather,\nit is a parser for HTML 5 compliant documents.  It does not\nimplement the HTML 5 parsing algorithm, and should\ngenerally be expected to perform correctly only on\ndocuments that you trust to conform to HTML 5.  This is\nnot a suitable library for implementing web crawlers or\nother software that will be exposed to documents from\noutside sources.  The result is also not the HTML 5\nnode structure, but rather something closer to the physical\nstructure.
