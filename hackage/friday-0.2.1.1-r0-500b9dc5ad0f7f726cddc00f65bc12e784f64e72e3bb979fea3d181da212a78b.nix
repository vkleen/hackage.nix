These images can be combined to produce\ncomplex transformations. By some inlining, Haskell\ncompilers are able to produce fast algorithms by\nremoving intermediate structures.\n\nThe library currently support four color spaces: RGB,\nRGBA, HSV and gray-scale images.\n\nPlease read our\n<https://github.com/RaphaelJ/friday/blob/master/README.md README>\nto get a detailed usage and some examples.";
