The @FormalGrammars@\nlibrary provides the required \"Template Haskell\" machinary.\n\nAlternatively, the resulting grammars can also be\npretty-printed in various ways (LaTeX, ANSI, Haskell module\nwith signature and grammar).\n\n\n\nFormal background can be found in two papers:\n@\nChristian Höner zu Siederdissen, Ivo L.
