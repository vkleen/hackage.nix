When dealing with blocks of network addresses, there are a\nfew things that one usually wants to do with them:\n\n* Create a regular expression matching the CIDR block(s). This is\nbecause grep will throw up if you feed it CIDR.\n\n* Combine small blocks into larger ones. For example, if you have two\nconsecutive \\/24s, they might combine into a larger \\/23.\n\n* View the result of block combination in a useful way.\n\nHath has four modes to perform these functions:\n\n[@Regexed@]\nThis computes a (Perl-compatible) regular expression matching\nthe input CIDR blocks. It's the default mode of operation.\n\n[@Reduced@]\nThis combines small blocks into larger ones where possible, and\neliminates redundant blocks. The output should be equivalent to\nthe input, though.\n\n[@Duped@]\nShows only the blocks that would be removed by reduce; that is, it\nshows the ones that would get combined into larger blocks or are\nsimply redundant.\n\n[@Diffed@]\nShows what would change if you used reduce. Uses diff-like\nnotation.\n\n/Examples/:\n\nCombine two \\/24s into a \\/23:\n\n@\n\$ hath reduced <<< \\\"10.0.0.0\\/24 10.0.1.0\\/24\\\"\n10.0.0.0/23\n@\n\nCreate a perl-compatible regex to be fed to grep:\n\n@\n\$ grep -P `hath regexed -i cidrs.txt` mail.log\n@";
