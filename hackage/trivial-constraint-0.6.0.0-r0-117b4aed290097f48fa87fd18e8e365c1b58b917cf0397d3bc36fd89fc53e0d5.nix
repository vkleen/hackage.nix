It is easy enough to define the\nlambdas in an ad-hoc manner as\n\n@\ntype Unconstrained² a b = ()\n@\n\nand then\n\n@\n(Cstrt², Unconstrained²) ~ (Unconstrained², Cstrt²) ~ Cstrt²\n@\n\nThis library provides those /trivial constraints/ in\na single, documented place, and it uses classes instead of\ntype-synonyms (which would be problematic when it comes to partial\napplication). Arities 0-9 are provided.\n\nThey can be useful in any construction that is parameterised over a\nconstrainer-class, when you do /not/ wish to actually constrain the\ndomain with it.\n\nThe other thing this library provides are the opposite classes,\ni.e. @\\\\a b ... -> Impossible@, constraints which can /never/ be\nfulfilled. They are essentially dual to the @Unconstrained@ ones,\nand can likewise be useful as parameters that should completely\n“disable” a conditional feature.";
