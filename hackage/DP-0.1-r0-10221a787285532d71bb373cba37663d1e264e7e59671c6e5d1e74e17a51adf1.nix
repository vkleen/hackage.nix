The specification is then translated into a form that can be\nsolved efficiently by a modular solver. Includes solvers using memoization,\nstrict and lazy ordered tables, and recursion with a range of data structures for the underlying table.\nThis method also separates processing steps like pruning and debugging from the recursion itself, and\nthis package contains preliminary tools for beam search and tracing.";
