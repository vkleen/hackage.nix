A reactive value is a /typed mutable value with access\nproperties and change propagation/. Access property can be read-only,\nread-write or read-write.\n\nHow an RV is actually implemented, and when and how change propagation is\nexecuted is dependent on each RV. For instance, Gtk widget properties would\nnormally use the standard event-handler installers to implement change\npropagation, whereas pure Haskell values might fork a thread (or not) and\npropagate changes asynchronously.\n\nRVs can be created from pure models (see\n<https://github.com/keera-studios/keera-hails/tree/master/keera-hails-mvc-model-lightmodel\nkeera-hails-mvc-model-lightmodel> and\n<https://github.com/keera-studios/keera-hails/tree/master/keera-hails-mvc-model-protectedmodel\nkeera-hails-mvc-model-protectedmodel>), Gtk+\\/WX\\/Qt\\/HTML DOM\\/Android widget\nproperties\\/event handlers\\/getters\\/setters, files, sockets, FRP networks.\nOther backends are also available.
