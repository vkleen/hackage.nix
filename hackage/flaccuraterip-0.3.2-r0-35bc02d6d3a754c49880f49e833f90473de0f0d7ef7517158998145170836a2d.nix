Open a shell in the directory containing the FLAC files, and\nrun:\n\n>\$ flaccuraterip track01.flac track02.flac ... trackNN.flac\n\nIf a pressing of this CD is present in the AccurateRip™ database,\n@flaccuraterip@ will output the ripping accuracy for each track. If the CD was\nripped without setting the drive offset, you should use the flag\n@--with-sample-offset=N@, where N is the offset indicated in\n<http://accuraterip.com/driveoffsets.htm> for your drive.";
