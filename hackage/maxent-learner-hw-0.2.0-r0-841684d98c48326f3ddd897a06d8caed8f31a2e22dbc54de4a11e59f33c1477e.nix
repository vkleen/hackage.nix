The learner takes in a lexicon and produces a list of weighted constraints penalizing certain sound sequemces in an attempt to produce a probability distribution of words which maximizes the probability of the lexicon. Once such a set of constraints is generated, it can be tested by using it to generate random pronounceable text.\n\nThis package is an implementation of the algorithm described in Hayes and Wilson's paper /A Maximum Entropy Model of Phonotactics and Phonotactic Learning/ (available at <http://www.linguistics.ucla.edu/people/hayes/Phonotactics/Index.htm>).";
