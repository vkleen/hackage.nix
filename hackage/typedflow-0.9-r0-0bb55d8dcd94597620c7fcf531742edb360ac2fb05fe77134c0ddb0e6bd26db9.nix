This choice makes sharing of parameters explicit and allows to implement \"layers\" as pure functions.\n\n- To provide as precise as possible types. Functions are explicit about the shapes and elements of the tensors that they manipulate (they are often polymorphic in shapes and elements though.)\n\n- To let combinators be as transparent as possible. If a NN layers is a simple tensor transformation it will be exposed as such.";
