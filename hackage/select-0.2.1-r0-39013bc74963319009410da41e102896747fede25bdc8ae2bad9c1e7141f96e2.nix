While at it, I took the\nopportunity to have what @select@ returns put in a 'TMVar'.\n\nThe package has three parts:\n\n[\"System.Posix.IO.Select\"] just wraps @select@.\n\n[\"Control.Concurrent.STM.TMVarIO\"] and \"Control.Concurrent.MVarIO\" put the\nreturn value of IO actions into a 'TMVar' or an 'MVar', respectively.\n\n[\"Control.Concurrent.STM.RunOrElse\"] defines functions that give you\nthe return value of whatever finishes first of an IO action and an STM\noperation.\n\n[\"System.Posix.IO.Select.STM\"] and \"System.Posix.IO.Select.MVar\" do the above\nfor the special case @select@.\n\n/NOTE/: I feel I'm occupying prime namespace realestate with a package name\nlike select. I'll happily let myself be chased away if anybody else wants\nto use this package name. Let me know.\n\n/NOTE 2/: The vector dependency comes from me not spending time figuring out\nhow to pass lists of data to C without first turning them into vectors. It'll\nprobably disappear soon.\n\n/CAVEAT/: I'm not an experienced Haskeller (as you can tell from note 2), and\nthis is my first foray into FFI in general. Use with caution.";
