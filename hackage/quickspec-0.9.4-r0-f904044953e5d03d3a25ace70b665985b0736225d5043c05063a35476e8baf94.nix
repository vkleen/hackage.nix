For example, given @reverse@, @++@\nand @[]@, QuickSpec finds six laws:\n\n> xs++[] == xs\n> []++xs == xs\n> reverse [] == []\n> (xs++ys)++zs == xs++(ys++zs)\n> reverse (reverse xs) == xs\n> reverse xs++reverse ys == reverse (ys++xs)\n\nAll you have to provide is:\n\n* Some functions and constants to test. These are the /only/\nfunctions that will appear in the equations.\n\n* A collection of variables that can appear in the equations\n(@xs@, @ys@ and @zs@ in the example above).\n\n* 'Test.QuickCheck.Arbitrary' and 'Data.Typeable.Typeable' instances for the types you want to test.\n\nConsider this a pre-release. Everything is complete but undocumented\n:) The best place to start is the examples at\n<http://github.com/nick8325/quickspec/tree/master/examples>. There\nis also a paper at\n<http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~nicsma/quickspec.pdf>.\nEverything you need should be in the module \"Test.QuickSpec\".\n\nIf you want help, email me!";
