Long term goals are focused\naround procedural content generation and include\nthe improvement of the AI monad EDSL, so that rules\nfor synthesising monster behaviour from game content\nare extensible, readable and easy to debug,\nin-game content creation, auto-balancing and persistent\ncontent modification based on player behaviour.\n\nA larger game that depends on the LambdaHack library\nis Allure of the Stars, available from\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/Allure>.";
