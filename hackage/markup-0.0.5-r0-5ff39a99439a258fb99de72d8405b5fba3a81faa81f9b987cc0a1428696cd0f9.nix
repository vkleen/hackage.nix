The three deployment mechanisms provided include /inline/ (content is\nslapped between markup tags), /hosted/ (entirely external - uses raw text as a\nurl), and /local/ (which uses the <hackage.haskell.org/package/urlpath urlpath>\nlibrary to realize what kind of link to create).\n\nAs an example, here is remotely hosted image:\n\n> image = deploy Image \"foo.png\" :: HostedMarkupM (Html ())\n>\n> λ> renderMarkup image\n>\n> <img src=\"foo.png\">\n\nHere is the same example, going relative instead:\n\n> image :: LocalMarkupM (HtmlT AbsoluteUrl ())\n> image = deploy Image \$ \"foo.png\" <?> (\"some\",\"getparam\")\n>\n> λ> (runUrlReader \$ renderTextT \$ renderMarkup image \$\n>    ) \"example.com\"\n>\n> \"<img src=\\\"example.com/foo.png?some=getparam\\\">\"";
