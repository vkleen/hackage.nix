It is not as\ncomplete as bindings-sqlite3, but is slightly higher-level, in that it\nsupports marshalling of data values to and from the database.  In\nparticular, it supports strings encoded as UTF8, and BLOBs represented\nas ByteStrings.\nVersion 2.1 improves handling of invalid UTF-8 and changes error handling\nto be more complete.  It also adds a build flag to build against the system\nsqlite instead of the bundled one, optionally (disabled by default).\nVersion 2.0 uses Text for strings instead of String.\nVersion 1.1.0.1 switches to the Faction packaging system and makes no other\nchanges.\nVersion 1.1 adds the SQLite amalgamation file (version 3.7.5) to the project, so that\nthere are no external dependencies.";
