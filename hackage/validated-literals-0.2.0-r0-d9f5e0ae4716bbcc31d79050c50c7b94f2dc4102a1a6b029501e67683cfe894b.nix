Forcing the user to go through a smart-constructor that\nenforces invariants and returns @Maybe ResultType@, preventing the\nconstruction of data with invalid values.\n\nHowever, it is __also__ common to want to include literal values of such\ntypes in source text. Things of textual literals for HTML, HTTP, etc.\nIn such cases smart-constructors force us to handle potential conversion\nfailures at runtime, or abusing functions like @fromJust@ to break away all\nthe safety smart-constructors provide. All this despite the fact that we\ncan statically know at compile time that the conversion will always succeed\nor always fails.\n\nThis package provides a typeclasses for using TH to validate the\ncorrectness of provided literals at compile. This lets you define, e.g.,\n@newtype Even = Even Integer@ and write:\n\n@\nx :: Even\nx = \$\$(valid 38)\n@\n\nThis will check, at compile time, that the provided @Integer@ is, in fact,\neven and unwrap it from @Maybe@, avoiding the runtime check.";
