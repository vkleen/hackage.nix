The\nADPfusion code compared to C is slower by a factor of only 1.8.\nWe plan to improve upon this.\n\nA number of helper functions currently present in\nBioInf.Nussinov78 will later move in their own library.\n\nIf possible, build using the GHC llvm backend, and GHC-7.2.2.\nGHC-7.4.x produces very bad code on my system, please benchmark\nusing 7.2.2.\n\nFor comparison, a version of the algorithm written in C is\navailable under C/nussinov.c.
