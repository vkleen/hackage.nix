You can generate many interesting reports\nincluding:\n\n* Show individual reports for all the fields measured e.g. @time taken@, @peak\nmemory usage@, @allocations@, among many other fields measured by @gauge@\n* Sort benchmark results on a specified criterion e.g. you may want to see the\nbiggest cpu hoggers or biggest memory hoggers on top\n* Across two benchmark runs (e.g. before and after a change), show all the\noperations that resulted in a regression of more than x% in descending\norder, so that we can quickly identify and fix performance problems in our\napplication.\n* Across two (or more) packages providing similar functionality, show all the\noperations where the performance differs by more than 10%, so that we can\ncritically analyze the packages and choose the right one.\n\nQuick Start: Use @gauge@ or @criterion@ to generate a @results.csv@ file, and\nthen use either the @bench-show@ executable or the library APIs to generate\ntextual or graphical reports.\n\n@\n\$ bench-show report results.csv\n\$ bench-show graph results.csv output\n@\n\n@\nreport \"results.csv\"  Nothing defaultConfig\ngraph  \"results.csv\" \"output\" defaultConfig\n@\n\nThere are many ways to present the reports, for example, you can show can\nshow % regression from a baseline in descending order textually as follows:\n\n@\n(time)(Median)(Diff using min estimator)\nBenchmark streamly(0)(Î¼s)(base) streamly(1)(%)(-base)\n\\--------- --------------------- ---------------------\nzip                      644.33                +23.28\nmap                      653.36                 +7.65\nfold                     639.96                -15.63\n@\n\nTo show the same graphically:\n\n<<src/docs/regression-percent-descending-median-time.svg>>\n\nSee the README and the \"BenchShow.Tutorial\" module for comprehensive\ndocumentation.";
