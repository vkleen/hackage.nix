Main differences:\n\n- console-program does not use unsafePerformIO, and tries to give a more haskellish, referentially transparent interface;\n\n- it allows a full tree of commands, instead of a list, so a command can have subcommands;\n\n- it parses a configuration file, in addition to the command line arguments.";
