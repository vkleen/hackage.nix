This library is far more efficient than using the\ndefault Data.List functions to approximate range behaviour. Performance is the major\nvalue offering of this library.\nIf this is your first time using this library it is highly recommended that you start\nwith \"Data.Range\"; it contains the basics of this library that meet most use\ncases.";
