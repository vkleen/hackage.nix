(Requested by Ben Lee)\n\n0.2.0.1 - Increase strictness slightly.\nRemove cabal target for test executable.\n(Just include test sources instead.)\n\n0.2 - Added an Eq instance for LRU.\nAdded strictness to eliminate space leaks in common use patterns.\n\n0.1.1 - Add the Data.Cache.LRU.IO.Internal module.\nClean up build warnings on GHC 6.12.1.\n\n0.1.0.1 - Minor refactoring\n\n0.1 - First release";
