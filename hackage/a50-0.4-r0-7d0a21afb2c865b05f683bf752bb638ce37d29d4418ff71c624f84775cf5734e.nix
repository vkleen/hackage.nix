Conversely, a poor assembly consisting of\nmany small fragments will have a less steep curve extending far to the right.\n\nThe graphs produced by a50 gives a simple and easy to grasp comparison between assemblies,\nand yet produces a more detailed and informative view than the usual metrics like largest\ncontig size or N50.\n\nThe Darcs repository is at <http://malde.org/~ketil/biohaskell/a50>.";
