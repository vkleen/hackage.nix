Just a few functions and two monads doing all the\nboilerplate job for you.\n\n* A powerful transaction abstraction, which provides\nan automated resolution of conflicts.\nThe API ensures that you're only able to perform a specific\nset of actions in the transaction context,\nwhich allows Hasql to safely resolve conflicting transactions\nby automatically retrying them.\nThis is much inspired by STM and ST.\n\n* Support for cursors. Allows to fetch virtually limitless result sets in a\nconstant memory using streaming.\n\n* Employment of prepared statements.\nEvery statement you emit gets prepared and cached.\nThis raises the performance of the backend.\n\n* Automated management of resources related to connections, transactions and\ncursors.\n\n* A built-in connections pool.\n\n* Compile-time generation of templates. You just can't write a statement with an\nincorrect number of placeholders.\n\n* Ability to map to any types actually supported by the backend.\n\nLinks:\n\n* <http://nikita-volkov.github.io/hasql-benchmarks/ Benchmarks analysis>.\n\n* <https://github.com/nikita-volkov/hasql/blob/master/demo/Main.hs Basic tutorial-demo>.\n\n* <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hasql-postgres PostgreSQL backend>.\n";
