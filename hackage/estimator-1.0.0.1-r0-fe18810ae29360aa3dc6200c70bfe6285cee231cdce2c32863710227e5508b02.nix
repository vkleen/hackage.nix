The\ninterface for constructing models is isolated as much as possible from\nthe specifics of a given algorithm, so swapping out a Kalman Filter\nfor a Bayesian Particle Filter should involve a minimum of effort.\n\nThis implementation is designed to support symbolic types, such as\nfrom <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/sbv sbv> or\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/ivory ivory>. As a result you can\ngenerate code in another language, such as C, from a model written\nusing this package; or run static analyses on your model.\n\nAlso included is a sophisticated sensor fusion example in\n\"Numeric.Estimator.Model.SensorFusion\", which may be useful in its own\nright.";
