It should guess a reasonable option based on\nthe files present in your project directory and so you will\njust have to press enter all the time. If you provide a\nbang, these questions will not be asked.\n\n@:GhcidStop@ stops the current ghcid process.\n\n@:GhcidRestart@ combines the two previous commands.\n\nSimply import the @plugin@ definition from \"Neovim.Ghcid\"\nand add it to your plugin list.";
