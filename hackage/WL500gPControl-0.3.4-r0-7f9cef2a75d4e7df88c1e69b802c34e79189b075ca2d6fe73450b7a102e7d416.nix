It has simple format:\n\n@\nuser: \\<user name\\>\npassword: \\<password\\>\nhost: \\<host name or IP address\\>\n@\n\nThe password should be in plain text, so it is recommended to protect this\nfile from reading for everyone except you.\n\nIf credentials file is not given, than programs will try to use default\ncredential file, which should be located:\n\n* on Linux: @\$HOME\\/.WL500gPControl\\/credentials@\n\n* on Windows: @C\\:\\\\Documents And Settings\\\\user\\\\Application Data\\\\WL500gPControl\\\\credentials@\n\nSometimes paths could be different.
