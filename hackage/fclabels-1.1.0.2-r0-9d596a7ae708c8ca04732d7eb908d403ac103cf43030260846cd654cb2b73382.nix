Labels can be used to /get/,\n/set/ and /modify/ parts of a datatype in a consistent way.\n\nSee \"Data.Label\" for an introductory explanation.\n\nInternally lenses are not tied to Haskell functions directly,\nbut are implemented as arrows. Arrows allow the lenses to be run\nin custom computational contexts. This approach allows us to\nmake partial lenses that point to fields of multi-constructor\ndatatypes in an elegant way.\n\nSee the \"Data.Label.Maybe\" module for the use of partial labels.\n\n> 1.1.0.1 -> 1.1.0.2\n>   - Fixed bug in `id` definition for `Lens (~>)`.";
