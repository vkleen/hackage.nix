The real-time sound rendering function dac spawns\na child process in the background which may continue to execute after you stop the main process that runs the programm.\nIt's not so in vim but it happens in the Sublime Editor and when you invoke runhaskell. So the best\nis to write you program in the separate file and then load it in the ghci and invoke the function main (which\nruns the sound rendering with the function dac).\n\nLibrary strives to be very simple. For example, to trigger the instrument with virtual midi-device is\nas simple as (in ghci with loaded modules \"Csound\" and \"Csound.Patch\")\n\n> Csound Csound.Patch> vdac \$ mul 0.2 \$ largeHall \$ onMidi stringPad\n\nIf you have a connected hardware midi-device you can just type:\n\n> Csound Csound.Patch> dac \$ mul 0.2 \$ largeHall \$ onMidi stringPad\n\nAnd you are ready to go. To play a C-major chord just do:\n\n> Csound Csound.Patch> dac \$ mul 0.2 \$ magicCave \$ mix \$ notes vibraphone2 \$ mel [c, e, g, high c, rest 15]\n\nHere we send the output to speakers (dac or vdac), scale the signal to make it quiter (mul),\nplace the signal in some room with reverberation (largeHall or magicCave), listen to midi\nevents (onMidi or onMidin for a midi on the given channel) or get the signal from scores (mix),\ntrigger the csound instrument (stringPad or vibraphone2) on events (notes) and construct\nthe events in sequence (mel). Events include notes (c, e, g - C major) and rests (rest).";
