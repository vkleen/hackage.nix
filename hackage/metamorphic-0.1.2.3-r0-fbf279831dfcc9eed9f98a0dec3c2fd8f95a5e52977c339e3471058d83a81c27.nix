Any mistakes in the code are almost surely\nmine, and not the original author's.\n\nFuture updates should include:\n\n* documentation\n\n* an abstract syntax graph version of the included functions\n\n* diagrams of involved structures\n\n* examples demonstrated by doctest\n\n* switch to hierarchical naming\n\n* switch to available versions of components (SimpleMap, Heap)\n\n* a more general license";
