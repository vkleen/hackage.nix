Its goals are the following:\n\n* Provide a powerful tree pattern matching specification\nlanguage with simplicity and easy readability in mind.\n\n* Perform good static analysis aiding during the design of\ngrammar specifications.\n\n* Provide back-ends which generate code for various languages\nfrom a specification, ready to be plugged into a back-end\ncompiler infrastructure. Currently Java Code is being generated.\n\nSee \"Homepage\" for an example on how to integrate the generated\ncode into a compiler.";
