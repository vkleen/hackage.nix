Monomorphism is used to\nfacilitate memoization, users should adapt their design to work with random\n'Int' values only.\n\nIn a benchmark, the initial generation of 100000 random 'Int's took 10.30\nseconds and consumed 2.5 gigabytes of memory. Generating the 100000 'Int's\nagain from the same seed only took 2.06 seconds, a 5-fold speedup thanks to\nmemoization!\n\nIncidentally, generating the 100000 'Int's with the non-memoized function\ntook 0.12 seconds, but that of course lacks all the benefits of memoization.";
