However, there\nare times when you want to provide a richer display for a\nvalue while still retaining the benefits of having\nderived @Show@ instances. This can be especially useful\nwhen working interactively in ghci. @Text.Display@\nprovides a tiny registered package with the @Display@\ntypeclass just for this purpose.\n\n<<https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/197051/20434593/74a2b66c-ad76-11e6-9eef-cff6352d08b1.png>>\n\nFor examples visit the\n<https://github.com/githubuser/pretty-display#readme README>";
