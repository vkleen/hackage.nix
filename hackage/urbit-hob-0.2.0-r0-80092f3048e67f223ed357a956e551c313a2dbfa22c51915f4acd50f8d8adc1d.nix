The \\@p encoding is used for naming ships; it uniquely\nrepresents a 32-bit number in a memorable and pronounceable fashion.\n\nThe \\@p encoding is an /obfuscated/ representation of an underlying 32-bit\nnumber, in particular, hence the \\\"ob\\\" in the library's name.\n\nThe @Urbit.Ob@ module exposes two functions, 'patp' and 'fromPatp', for\nconverting between representations.  You can also render a 'Patp' value via\nthe 'render' function, or parse one via 'parse'.\n\nSome quick examples:\n\n>>> :set -XOverloadedStrings\n>>> import qualified Urbit.Ob as Ob\n>>>\n>>> let nidsut = Ob.patp 15663360\n>>> Ob.render nidsut\n\"~nidsut-tomdun\"\n>>> Ob.fromPatp nidsut\n15663360\n>>> Ob.parse \"~nidsut-tomdun\"\nRight ~nidsut-tomdun";
