Due to the use of `inotify_init1`,  `linux-inotify` currently\nrequires linux 2.6.27 or later,  even though `inotify` support\ndebuted in linux 2.6.13.   You can check which version of linux is\non a machine via `uname -a`.   I would like to fix this at some point,\nbut it isn't a personal priority.\n\n2.   `linux-inotify` requires GHC 7.0.2 or later,  whereas `hinotify`\nworks with many versions of GHC 6.   I have no plans to fix this.";
