The resulting structure can then be encoded as a valid IAM JSON\npolicy document for using with Amazon IAM and related services.\n\nThe details of what goes into a policy vary for each service, depending on what\nactions the service makes available, what types of resources it contains, and\nso on. When you're writing policies for a specific service, it's helpful to see\nexamples of policies for that service.
