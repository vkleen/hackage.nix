Put another way, React-Haskell doesn't support lifecycle methods yet.\n\nHere's a simple example which demonstrates basic elements, attributes, state, and handling events.\n\n> -- We're creating a class with JSString state\n> data Example\n> instance ReactKey Example where\n>     type ClassState Example = JSString\n>     type AnimationState Example = ()\n>     type Signal Example = JSString\n>\n> -- updating to the new state without animation\n> transition :: JSString -> JSString -> (JSString, [AnimConfig Example])\n> transition oldState signal = (signal, [])\n>\n> view :: JSString -> React Example ()\n> view str = div_ [ class_ \"container\" ] \$ do\n>     input_ [ value_ str, onChange (Just . value . target) ]\n>\n> main :: IO ()\n> main = withElem \"id\" \$ \\elem ->\n>     render elem =<< createClass view transition \"\" () []";
