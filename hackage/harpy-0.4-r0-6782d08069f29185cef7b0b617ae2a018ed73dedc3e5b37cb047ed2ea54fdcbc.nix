The\ndisassmbler can be found in module \"Harpy.X86Disassembler\".\n\n* Some abstractions over the abovementioned code generation modules,\nsuch as automatic label management and code generation\ncombinators (for if-then-else statements, while-loops, functions)\n(module \"Harpy.X86CGCombinators\").\n\n* All the above modules use the code generation monad defined in module\n\"Harpy.CodeGenMonad\".\n\n* The Darcs repo and two tutorials on using Harpy can be found at\nHarpy's homepage: <http://uebb.cs.tu-berlin.de/harpy/>";
