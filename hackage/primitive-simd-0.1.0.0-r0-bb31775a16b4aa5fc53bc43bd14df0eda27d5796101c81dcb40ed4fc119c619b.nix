Instances\nfor numeric operations, 'Prim', 'Storable' and unboxed vector\ninstances are provided.\n\nAlthough not all processors support 256 or 512-bit vectors\nthis package provides a uniform interface. Vectors which\nare bigger than supported are modeled by combining smaller\nvectors. If the same code is compiled on a computer supporting\nlarger vectors the smaller vectors are replaced by larger\nvectors.\n\nNote: This package needs to be compiled with LLVM as the NCG\ndoes not know how to deal with SIMD-instructions. If LLVM is\nnot available, use -f no-vec to disable the use of SIMD instructions.\nWhile this will give you no speedup, it will work with plain\nHaskell (and should even work with GHCJS).";
