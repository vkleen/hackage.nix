      description = "Based on Wouter Swierstra's Functional Pearl /Data types à la carte/\n(Journal of Functional Programming, 18(4):423-436, 2008),\nthis package provides a framework for defining recursive\ndata types in a compositional manner. The fundamental idea of\ncompositional data types is to separate the signature of a data type\nfrom the fixed point construction that produces its recursive\nstructure. By allowing to compose and decompose signatures,\n/compositional data types/ enable to combine data types in a flexible\nway. The key point of Wouter Swierstra's original work is to define\nfunctions on /compositional data types/ in a compositional manner as\nwell by leveraging Haskell's type class machinery.\n\nBuilding on that foundation, this library provides additional\nextensions and (run-time) optimisations which makes compositional data types\nusable for practical implementations. In particular, it\nprovides an excellent framework for manipulating and analysing\nabstract syntax trees in a type-safe manner. Thus, it is perfectly\nsuited for programming language implementations, especially, in an environment\nconsisting of a family of tightly interwoven /domain-specific languages/.\n\nIn concrete terms, this package provides the following features:\n\n*  Compositional data types in the style of Wouter Swierstra's\nFunctional Pearl /Data types à la carte/.\n\n*  Modular definition of function on compositional data types through\ncatamorphisms and anamorphisms as well as more structured\nrecursion schemes such as primitive recursion  and co-recursion,\nand course-of-value iteration and co-iteration.\n\n*  Support for monadic computations via monadic variants of all\nrecursion schemes.\n\n*  Support of a succinct programming style over compositional data types\nvia generic programming combinators that allow various forms of\ngeneric transformations and generic queries.\n\n*  Generalisation of compositional data types (terms) to\ncompositional data types \\\"with holes\\\" (contexts). This allows\nflexible reuse of a wide variety of catamorphisms (called\n/term homomorphisms/) as well as an efficient composition of them.\n\n*  Operations on signatures, for example, to add and remove\nannotations of abstract syntax trees. This includes combinators to\npropagate annotations fully automatically through certain\nterm homomorphisms.\n\n*  Optimisation of the implementation of recursion schemes. This\nincludes /short-cut fusion/ style optimisation rules which yield a\nperformance boost of up to factor six.\n\n*  Automatic derivation of instances of all relevant type classes for\nusing compositional data types via /Template Haskell/. This includes\ninstances of 'Prelude.Eq', 'Prelude.Ord' and 'Prelude.Show' that are\nderived via instances for functorial variants of them. Additionally,\nalso /smart constructors/, which allow to easily construct inhabitants\nof compositional data types, are automatically generated.\n\n*  /Mutually recursive data types/. All of the above is also lifted to\nfamilies of mutually recursive data types.\n\nFor examples illustrating the use of compositional data types, consult\n\"Data.Comp\" resp. \"Data.Comp.Multi\" for mutually recursive data types.";
