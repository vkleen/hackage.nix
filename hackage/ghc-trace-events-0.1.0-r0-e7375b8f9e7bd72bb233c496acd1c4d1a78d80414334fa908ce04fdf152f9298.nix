Unlike the\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base/docs/Debug-Trace.html#g:2 eventlog tracing functions in base>,\nall the tracing functions in this library don't evaluate the input if user\nevent logging (the\n<https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/runtime_control.html#rts-flag--l%20⟨flags⟩ -lu>\nflag) is disabled, which can give a significant boost in performance. Take a\nlook at the benchmark suite for the details.\n\nThis library provies the following modules:\n\n[\"Debug.Trace.String\"] Drop-in replacements for the event tracing functions in\n\"Debug.Trace\".\n[\"Debug.Trace.ByteString\"] UTF-8 encoded 'Data.ByteString.ByteString' variants\nof the event tracing functions. It's faster than the String variants.\n[\"Debug.Trace.Text\"] 'Data.Text.Text' variants of the event tracing functions\nin \"Debug.Trace\". It's faster than the String variants.\n[\"Debug.Trace.Binary\"] Arbitary binary object logging available for GHC 8.8 or\nlater.
