Expressions can then be evaluated using the function @evaluate@\n(e.g. @evaluate@ (fromAscList [(\\\"x\\\",2)]) (Add (Mul (Num 3.0) (Var \\'x\\'))) (Num 2.0) would give 8.0).\nIf you wish to evaluate a string-expression without any intermediate symbolic logic operations, simply use the function\n@evaluateExpression@ (e.g. @evaluateExpression@ \\\"3*x+2\\\" [(\\'x\\',4)] gives 14.0). More examples of these functions can be found\nby viewing the source code for this package.";
