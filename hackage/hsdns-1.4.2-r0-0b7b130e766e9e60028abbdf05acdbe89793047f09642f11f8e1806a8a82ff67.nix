There is also support for retrieving generic\nRR types, CNAMEs, and for NSEC zone walking. The library\ncan be expected to work with fine ADNS 1.4 or later. It\nmight also work with version ADNS 1.3, but that hasn’t\nbeen tested.\n\nThe example program adns-reverse-lookup.hs demonstrates\nhow the resolver is used. Given a list of host names on\nthe command line, it performs an A/PTR double-lookup and\nchecks whether the records are consistent. The\noutput is printed in the order in which the DNS responses\narrive:\n\n> \$ ./adns-reverse-lookup xyz.example.org ecrc.de www.example.com www.cryp.to\n> OK: www.example.com <-> 208.77.188.166\n> ERR: xyz.example.org: cannot resolve A\n> FAIL: www.cryp.to -> 195.234.152.69 -> [\"research.cryp.to\"]\n> FAIL: ecrc.de -> 127.0.0.1 -> [\"localhost\"]";
