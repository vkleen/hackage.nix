Some notable features are:\n\n* Reads both darcs1 and darcs2.0 (hashed) format repositories.\n\n* Displays patch summaries per user and per repository.\n\n* Patch diff can be reviewed directly.\n\n* Download link for each patch, to apply without searching for the email.\n\n* Knows about inverse and amend-recorded patches and uses them to consider\npatches obsolete.";
