The DOM is a low level HTML tree manipulation API. That makes the creation and manipulation of DOM elements almost as painful as in JavaScript.\n\nThis package makes the creation of DOM elements easy with a syntax similar to other haskell HTML generators, using monoids and monads, such is the case of the package blaze-html.\n\nhttp://hackage.haskell.org/package/blaze-html\n\nSince the creation is in the browser, that permit quite dynamic pages for data\npresentation, and interctive textual (a.k.a \"serious\") applications and in general\nthe development of client-side web frameworks using haskell with the haste compiler.";
