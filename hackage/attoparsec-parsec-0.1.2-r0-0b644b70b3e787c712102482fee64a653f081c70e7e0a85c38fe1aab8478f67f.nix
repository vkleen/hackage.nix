Compiling an Attoparsec parser\nagainst Parsec can be useful for at least two scenarios.\n\n- Parsec can be used while developing Attoparsec parsers, so\nthat you get better error messages on failing test cases.\n\n- You can use Attoparsec for parsing, so that you benefit\nfrom it's speed.  And on parse errors you can re-parse the\ninput with Parsec, so that you can display a useful error\nmessage to the user.\n\nA simple usage example is here:\n<https://github.com/sol/attoparsec-parsec#readme>";
