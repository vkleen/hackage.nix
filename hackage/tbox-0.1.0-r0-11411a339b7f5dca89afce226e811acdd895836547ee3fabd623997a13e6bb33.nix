      description = "This package provides STM data structures with IO hooks.\nThe basic building blocks are instances of class 'TBox'. Such an\ninstance is an STM variable that might contain a value of\nsome type 'a'. In contrast to a plain 'TVar (Maybe a)', a\n'TBox' has IO hooks that are executed transparently on writes and reads.\nThe IO hooks of the 'AdvSTM' monad extend the atomicity of STM transactions\nto the on-commit IO actions, which makes it particularly suitable for\nimplementing a persistent and thread-safe storage.\n\nSee module Control.Concurrent.TFile for a (simple) instance of a 'TBox'\nthat serializes its content to a file via 'Data.Binary'.\n\nNew in this release is the implementation of a skip list in module\nControl.Concurrent.TBox.TSkipList. A skip list is a probabilistic data\nstructure that provides expected run time of /O(log n)/ for\ndictionary operations (insert, lookup, filter, delete, update) similar to\na balanced tree.\nThe main advantage of a skip list is that it does not need rebalancing,\nwhich could cause lots of contention among transactions.\nThe 'TFile' skip list instance tries to reconstruct its content from the\n'TFile'-directory. See module Control.Concurrent.TFile.TSkipList for a\nusage example.\n\nFeedback is highly appreciated!";
