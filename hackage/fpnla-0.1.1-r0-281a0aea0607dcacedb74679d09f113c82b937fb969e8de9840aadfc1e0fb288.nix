For this reason the design of the framework is strongly oriented to these libraries. Anyway it is possible to easily define operations not considered in these libraries and still maintaining the above properties.\n\nMany representations and strategy definitions (from which many are parallel) can be found in the @fpnla-examples@ (<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/fpnla-examples>) package.\n\nDetails about the package may be found in the paper: Towards a functional run-time for dense NLA domain.
