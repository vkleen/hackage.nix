After defining an\ninstance of this class for your particular graph node type, simply call\n'LinearScan.Hoopl.allocateHoopl'. This is a simpler interface than using\n@linearscan@ directly, which requires two records of functions that are more\ngeneral in nature than the methods of 'NodeAlloc'.\n\nSecond, it provides a DSL for constructing assembly language DSLs that\ncompile into Hoople program graphs. See the tests for a concrete example.\nThis is mainly useful for constructing tests of intermediate representations.\n\nPlease see the tests for an example of the simple assembly language that is\nused to test the @linearscan@ allocator.";
