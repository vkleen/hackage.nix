By default,\nit outputs a textual representation of the data in the SFF-file, much like\n'sffinfo' from Roche does.\n\nThe fselect executable extracts reads from SFF-files, generating a new\nSFF-file with a subset of the reads based on various criteria.\n\nSometimes SFF files will appear to be corrupted, with all-zero blocks in the\nfile. The frecover program ignores these and tries to resync with the file after an\ninvalid region.  This was likely a one-time bug in the 454 software, so this program\nis probably not so useful any more.";
