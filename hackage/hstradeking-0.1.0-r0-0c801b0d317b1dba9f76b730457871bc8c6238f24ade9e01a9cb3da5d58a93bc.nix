This will create an executable called `tradeking`. To\nconnect to the TradeKing API, you will need to create a new personal application from the\nTradeKing developers site. This should give you four strings: an OAuth consumer key, an OAuth\nconsumer secret, an OAuth Token, and an OAuth Token Secret. You supply these into the\n`tradeking` application using a configuration file (either `\$(HOME)/.tradeking` or\n`/etc/tradeking.conf`). This configuration file should look like:\n\n> consumer-key = <tradeking consumer key>\n> consumer-secret = <tradeking consumer secret>\n> oauth-token = <tradeking oauth token>\n> oauth-token-secret = <tradeking oauth token secret>\n\nNow you can run `tradeking quote SPY` to have it return the current quote for the S&P 500\nETF. `tradeking info MSFT` will provide information on Microsoft, and `tradeking stream MSFT`\nwill provide a live stream of `MSFT` quotes. All commands accept more than one stock, so\n`tradeking quote MSFT AAPL`, `tradeking info MSFT SPY`, and `tradeking stream SPY AAPL` work as\nexpected (subject to TradeKing) limits.\n\nYou can also request quotes programmatically, using the API described here.";
