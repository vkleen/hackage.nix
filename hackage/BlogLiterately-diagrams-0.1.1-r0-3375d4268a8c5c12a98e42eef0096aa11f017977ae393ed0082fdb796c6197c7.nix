For most users it\nshould suffice to simply use @BlogLiteratelyD@ in\nplace of @BlogLiterately@.\n\nTo use it, include code blocks with the @dia@ or\n@dia-def@ class (using pandoc's special extended\nMarkdown syntax\n(<http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/demo/example9/pandocs-markdown.html>),\nor BlogLiterately's extended syntax for tagged\ncode blocks\n(<http://byorgey.wordpress.com/blogliterately/>)),\nlike so:\n\n>     [dia-def]\n>     -- This block produces no output but its\n>     -- declarations will be in scope in all the\n>     -- rest of the diagram blocks.\n>\n>     gSq = square 1 # fc green\n>\n> NOTE: Square brackets below should be replaced\n> by curly braces.
