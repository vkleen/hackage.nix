It also has\nparameterised modules, mixfix operators, Unicode characters, and an\ninteractive Emacs interface (the type checker can assist in the\ndevelopment of your code).\n\nAgda is also a proof assistant: It is an interactive system for\nwriting and checking proofs. Agda is based on intuitionistic type\ntheory, a foundational system for constructive mathematics developed\nby the Swedish logician Per Martin-L&#xf6;f. It has many\nsimilarities with other proof assistants based on dependent types,\nsuch as Coq, Epigram and NuPRL.\n\nNote that if you want to use the command-line program (agda), then\nyou should also install the Agda-executable package. The Agda\npackage includes an Emacs mode for Agda, but you need to set up the\nEmacs mode yourself (for instance by running @agda-mode setup@; see\nthe README).\n\nNote also that this library does not follow the package versioning\npolicy, because the library is only intended to be used by the Emacs\nmode and the Agda-executable package.";
