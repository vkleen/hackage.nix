That being said, they should serve to succinctly illustrate\na number of optimization techniques from the modern optimization\nliterature.\n\nThose seeking a high-level overview of some of these methods are\nreferred to Stephen Wright's excellent tutorial from NIPS 2010\n<http://videolectures.net/nips2010_wright_oaml/>. A deeper\nintroduction can be found in Boyd and Vandenberghe's *Complex\nOptimization* which available freely online.";
