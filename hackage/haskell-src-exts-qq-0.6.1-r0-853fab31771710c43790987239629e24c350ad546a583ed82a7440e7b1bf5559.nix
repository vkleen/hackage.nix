For instance:\n\n> let x = Hs.name \"n\" in [hs| \\ ((x)) -> \$(Hs.Var (Hs.UnQual x)) + 1 |]\n\n* Antiquoting bound names. Names that are antiquoted appear\nsurrounded by double underscores. For instance:\n\n> let f = \"incr\"\n>     fE = Hs.Var \$ Hs.UnQual \$ Hs.name f\n> in [hs| let __f__ x = x + 1 in \$fE 10 |]\n\nWe need three different syntaxes for antiquotations, because we do\nnot extend the haskell-src-exts parser in any way and the Template\nHaskell splicing syntax is only available in expression contexts.";
