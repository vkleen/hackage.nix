However, this package\ncan be used to emulate subkinds of kind&#xA0;@*@ and subkind variables.\n\nTo define a new subkind, the user declares a type that represents the subkind, and\ninstantiates some classes. Afterwards, the user can declare types to be of that\nsubkind and universally quantify over the inhabitants of the subkind. Since subkinds\nare represented by types, type-level polymorphism can be used to emulate kind-level\npolymorphism.";
