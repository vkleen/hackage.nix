Specifically, the library allows for\n\n* optimisation of table algebra (a variant of relational algebra) expressions\n\n* and compilation of table algebra expressions into SQL:1999 queries\n\nNote that the C source bundle of Pathfinder is also included in this\npackage. The C sources are automatically built along with the Haskell FFI\nbindings. There is no need to download and install Pathfinder separately.\n\nMore information about Pathfinder is available from the following web page:\n\n* <http://www-db.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/research/pathfinder>";
