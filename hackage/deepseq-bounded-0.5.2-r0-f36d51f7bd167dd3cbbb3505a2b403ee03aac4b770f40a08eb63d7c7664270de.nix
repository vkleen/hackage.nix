There may be activity on this <http://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/2pscxh/ann_deepseqbounded_seqaid_leaky/ reddit> discussion, where your comments are invited.\n\nQuoting comments from the\n<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/deepseq deepseq> package:\n\n\\\"/Artificial forcing is often used for adding strictness to a program, e.g. in order to force pending exceptions, remove space leaks, or force lazy IO to happen. It is also useful in parallel programs, to ensure work does not migrate to the wrong thread./\\\"\n\nSometimes we don't want to, or cannot, force all the way.\nAny infinite recursive type is an example. Also, bounded forcing\nbridges the theoretical axis between shallow seq and full deepseq.\n\nWe provide two new classes \"NFDataN\" and \"NFDataP\". Instances of these\nprovide bounded deep evaluation for arbitrary polytypic terms:\n\n* 'rnfn' bounds the forced evaluation by depth of recursion.\n\n* 'rnfp' forces based on patterns (static or dynamic).\n\nInstances of \"NFDataN\" and \"NFDataP\" can be automatically derived via\n\"Generics.SOP\", backed by the \"GNFDataN\" and \"GNFDataP\" modules.\n\nAnother approach is \"Seqable\", which is similar to \"NFDataN\",\nbut optimised for use as a dynamically-reconfigurable forcing harness\nin the <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/seqaid seqaid> auto-instrumentation tool.\n\nRecent developments supporting parallelisation control (in \"Pattern\"\nand \"Seqable\" modules) may justify renaming this library to\nsomething which emcompasses both strictness and parallelism aspects.";
