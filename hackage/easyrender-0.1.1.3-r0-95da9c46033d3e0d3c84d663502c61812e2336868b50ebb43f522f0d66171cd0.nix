It provides an abstraction for multi-page documents, as well\nas a set of graphics primitives for page descriptions.\n\nThe graphics model is similar to that of the PostScript and PDF\nlanguages, but we only implement a subset of their functionality.\nCare has been taken that graphics rendering is done efficiently and\nas lazily as possible; documents are rendered \\\"on the fly\\\",\nwithout the need to store the whole document in memory.\n\nThe provided document description model consists of two separate\nlayers of abstraction:\n\n* /drawing/ is concerned with placing marks on a fixed surface, and\ntakes place in the 'Draw' monad;\n\n* /document structure/ is concerned with a sequence of pages, their\nbounding boxes, and other meta-data. It takes place in the\n'Document' monad.\n\nIn principle, the functionality provided by EasyRender is similar to\na subset of Cairo; however, EasyRender is lightweight and at least\nan order of magnitude faster.";
