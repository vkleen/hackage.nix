This gives an alternative to using 'Ref' for observable sharing.\n\nObservable sharing in general is unsafe, so we use the IO monad to bound this effect,\nbut can be used safely even with 'unsafePerformIO' if some simple conditions are met.\nTypically this package will be used to tie the knot with DSL's that depend of\nobservable sharing, like Lava.\n\nProviding an instance for 'MuRef' is the mechanism for allowing a structure to be\nreified into a graph, and several examples of this are provided.\n\nVersion 0.2 of 'data-reify' uses 'StableName's, and is much faster.\nVersion 0.3 provided two versions of 'MuRef', the mono-typed version, for trees of a single type,\nand the dynamic-typed version, for trees of different types.\n\n&#169; 2009-2012 Andy Gill & Conal Elliott; BSD3 license.";
