This includes gate-by-gate descriptions of circuit fragments, as well as powerful operators for assembling and manipulating circuits.\n\n* A monadic semantics, allowing for a mixture of procedural and declarative programming styles.\n\n* Built-in facilities for automatic synthesis of reversible quantum circuits, including from classical code.\n\n* Support for hierarchical circuits.\n\n* Extensible quantum data types.\n\n* Programmable circuit transformers.\n\n* Support for three execution phases: compile time, circuit generation time, and circuit execution time. A dynamic lifting operation to allow circuit generation to be parametric on values generated at circuit execution time.\n\n* Extensive libraries of quantum functions, including: libraries for quantum integer and fixed-point arithmetic; the Quantum Fourier transform; an efficient Qram implementation; libraries for simulation of pseudo-classical circuits, Stabilizer circuits, and arbitrary circuits; libraries for exact and approximate decomposition of circuits into specific gate sets.\n\nThis package contains the rendering part, which has been separated to reduce dependencies in quipper-core.";
