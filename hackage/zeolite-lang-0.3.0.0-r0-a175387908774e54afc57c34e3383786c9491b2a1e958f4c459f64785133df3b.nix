See\n<https://github.com/ta0kira/zeolite Zeolite on GitHub> for more details.\n\nThe installation process is still a bit rough, and therefore must be done in a\nfew stages:\n\n* Ensure that you have a C++ compiler such as @clang++@ or @g++@ installed,\nand an archiver such as @ar@ installed, all callable from a shell.\n* Install the binaries using @cabal@. After this step, the compiler itself is\ninstalled, but it cannot actually create executables from source code.\n\n@\ncabal install zeolite-lang\n@\n\n* Execute the setup binary that gets installed by @cabal@. This will give you\na series of prompts to verify the binaries above. It will then\nautomatically build the supporting libraries.\n\n@\nzeolite-setup\n@\n\n* (Optional) Once the setup above is completed, you should run the\nintegration tests to ensure that code can be compiled and run. These can\ntake quite a while to complete.
