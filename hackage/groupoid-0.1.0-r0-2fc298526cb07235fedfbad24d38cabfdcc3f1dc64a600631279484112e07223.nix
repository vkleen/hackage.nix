The union\noperation on bounding boxes is essential to track the extent\nof shapes after their superimposition. To fit bounding box\nunion into the Monoid typeclass one can do a clever trick\nrepresenting mempty with the bottom-left corner at positive\ninfinity and the top-right corner at negative infinity, the\nstandard implementation of union which uses min and max will\nstill proceed to identify the extreme corners correctly. This\nis nice enough if the bounding box coordinates are represented\nby Doubles, but a problem if they are Ints (say representing\ngrid coordinates) - one might decide it is better simply to\nconsider concrete bounding boxes and not their empty/infinite\ncousins.";
