Unlike the\nstandard session snaplet, sessions can be of an\narbitrary type appropriate to the application.\nClient-side session data is encrypted for security,\nand sessions have a configurable timeout (optional\nfor the client-side back end).\n\nIn addition, a library is provided for a\ncontinuation-based programming model called\nSnap Dialogues.  Dialogues allow natural\nspecification of stateful interactions with the\nclient that span multiple requests.  Because the\nsession type is not serializable, this requires the\nmemory-backed session implementation.";
