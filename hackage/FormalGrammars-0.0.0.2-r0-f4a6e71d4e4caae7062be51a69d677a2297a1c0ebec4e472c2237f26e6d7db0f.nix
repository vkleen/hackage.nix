This\nlibrary provides basic data types and functions to manipulate\nsuch grammars.\n\nGrammars can be defined in a small domain-specific language\nthat is very close to typical CFG notation.\n\nIn addition, TemplateHaskell and QuasiQuoting functionality\nallow embedding thusly defined grammars in Haskell programs.\nADPfusion then turns such a grammar into an efficient dynamic\nprogram. It is also possible to generate Haskell modules that\ncontain the resulting grammar, signature and algebra product.\n\nAlternatives are ansi- or LaTeX-based pretty-printing for users\nthat want to implement their CFG in another language than\nHaskell.\n\n\n\nFormal background can be found in two papers:\n@\nChristian Höner zu Siederdissen, Ivo L.
