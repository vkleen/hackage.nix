Shakespeare templates can be used inline with a quasi-quoter or in an external file. Shakespeare interpolates variables according to the type being inserted.\nIn this case, the variable type needs a ToJavascript instance.\n\nThere is also shakespeare-coffeescript for coffeescript templates. Coffescript is a language that compiles down to javascript. It expects a coffeescript compiler in your path, and variable should be a ToCoffee instance. And we even have a Roy template for the adventorous FP addicts.\n\nPlease see http://www.yesodweb.com/book/shakespearean-templates for a more thorough description and examples\n\nshakespeare-js was originally called julius, and shakespeare originated from the hamlet template package.";
