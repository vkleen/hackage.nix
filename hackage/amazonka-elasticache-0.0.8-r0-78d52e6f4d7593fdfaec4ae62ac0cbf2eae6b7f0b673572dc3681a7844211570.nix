Through integration with Amazon\nCloudWatch, Amazon ElastiCache provides enhanced visibility into key\nperformance metrics associated with your Memcached or Redis nodes.\n\n/See:/ <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html AWS API Reference>\n\n/Warning:/ This is an experimental preview release which is still under\nheavy development and not intended for public consumption, caveat emptor!";
