At this moment, there's\nno good documentation on how to use them, so please\nread the code for \"Bindings.C\" to understand how they work, or\njust fill question\\/sugestion reports in the bug tracking web\nsite.\n(/Caveat/: fields of a struct declared as arrays are\nnot properly supported in this release.
