The typing constraint ensures that\nthe second type parameter of a former value\nunifies with the first type parameter of the\nlatter.\n\nThis threading of types is the foundation for\nthrists' nice properties. E.g., paired with a\nsuitable semantics, function composition \$(.)\$\ncan be embedded.\n\nTechnically a thrist is embodying the concept\nof a /free category/.\n\nSub-modules demonstrate the power of the thrist\nidea by emulating some familiar data structures.\n\nFor further ideas, please consult the companion\n(draft) paper \\\"Thrists: Dominoes of Data\\\" at\n<https://github.com/ggreif/omega/blob/master/doc/Thrist-draft-2011-11-20.pdf>";
