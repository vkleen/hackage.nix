Routes are specified using bijections and invariant functors, allowing run-time composition (routes can be distributed across modules), reverse and forward routing derived from the same specification, and O(log n) lookups.\n\nThere are four steps/components of this package.\n\n1. Route endpoint specification: \"Web.Route.Invertible.Common\"\n\n2. Route map construction: \"Web.Route.Invertible.Common\"\n\n3. Route map lookup: \"Web.Route.Invertible\" (for the generic interface), \"Web.Route.Invertible.Wai\", \"Web.Route.Invertible.Snap\", or \"Web.Route.Invertible.Happstack\"\n\n4. Reverse routing: \"Web.Route.Invertible\" or \"Web.Route.Invertible.URI\"\n\nMost users will just want to import a framework-specific module like \"Web.Route.Invertible.Wai\" (or the generic \"Web.Route.Invertible\"), each of which re-exports \"Web.Route.Invertible.Common\".\nSee test/Main.hs for some examples.";
