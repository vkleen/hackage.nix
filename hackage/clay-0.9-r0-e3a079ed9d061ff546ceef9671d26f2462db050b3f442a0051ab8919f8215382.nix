This means that all CSS selectors\nand style rules are first class Haskell functions, which makes reuse and\ncomposability easy.\n\nThe project is described on <http://fvisser.nl/clay>.\n\nThe API documentation can be found in the top level module \"Clay\".\n\n> 0.8 -> 0.9\n>  - Added list-style-type property.\n>  - Added some CSS3 selectors and pseudo-classes.\n>  - Added some missing HTML5 elements.\n>  - Added keyframes support.\n>  - Fixed bug in linear in transition.\n>  - Added Initial and Unset type classes.\n>  - Added animation related styling rules.\n>  - Restored old renderer.\n>  - Fixed bunch of warnings.\n>  - Added :last-child pseudo selector.\n>  - Stub test suite\n>  Thanks to Sergei Trofimovich, Levi Ad, Ian D.
