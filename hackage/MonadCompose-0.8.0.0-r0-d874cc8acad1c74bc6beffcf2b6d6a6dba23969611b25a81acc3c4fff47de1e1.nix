The Distributive module implements distributivity for monad transformers.\n\nA monad transformer can transform another monad, but if you have two monads both lacking a transformer, there is little you can do in general. However, you can compose them in a coproduct construction. The PlusMonad module implements a similar plan, but differs from coproducts in that it doesn't compress together contiguous uses of a monad.";
