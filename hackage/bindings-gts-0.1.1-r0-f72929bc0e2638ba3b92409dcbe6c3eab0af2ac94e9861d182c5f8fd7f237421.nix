Any\nerrors in these bindings are my responsibility not that of\nthe GTS team.\n\nChangelog:\n\n[0.0.1] Initial version.\n\n[0.0.2] Improved documentation; added some missing functions;\nfixed a function name; bumped version of base to >=4\n\n[0.0.3] Adding missing GTS enumeration for CSG boolean\noperations; added some more missing functions; fixed some bad\nFunPtr references; added some helper methods, added missing\nGTS_inline.h header to sdist archive\n\n[0.1.1] Bindings reorganized by Maur√≠cio Antunes, author\nof Bindings-DSL. Bindings much improved as a result. This\nis an incompatible API change but should be the last change\nto the package organization. Should now cover all of the GTS\nlibrary. Some features (GSList etc) moved into Bindings-GLib\n(<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/bindings-glib>)\nas they should be there.\n";
