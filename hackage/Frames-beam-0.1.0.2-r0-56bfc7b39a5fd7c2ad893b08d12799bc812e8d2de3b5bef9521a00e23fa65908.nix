Additionally, provides utilities to convert plain Haskell records (i.e. the format of query results)\nto vinyl records (upon which the Frames library is based). Can be used for interactive exploration by loading\nall data in-memory at once (and converting to a data frame), and also in a constant memory streaming mode.\nStart here: \"Frames.SQL.Beam.Postgres\".";
