It's supposed to play nicely with @Control.Monad.Trans@.\n\nIn order to make a new transformer (say, @T@) an instance of @TransM@ (@TransP@, @TransF@) class, all you have to do is:\n\n* define @instance MonadTrans T@ &#x2014; which you've probably done already\n\n* define @instance Monad m => Monad (T m)@ &#x2014; also something quite common (for @TransP@ and @TransF@ you'd need another instance for @MonadPlus@ and @MonadFix@, respectively).\n\n* write @instance Trans T where transMInst = instM@ &#x2014; which is exactly one line of boilerplate. Sorry for that.\n\nAfter that, you can use your new and shiny transformer in compositions, like @ReaderT Char :. T :. WriterT String@ &#x2014; and such a composition would automagically become a monad transmormer.";
