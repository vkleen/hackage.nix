The plugin is compatible with GHC 7.10\nthrough 8.3, exporting a consistent (albeit somewhat lossy) representation\nacross these versions. The AST is encoded as CBOR, which is small and easy to\ndeserialise.\n\nThis package provides the AST and compiler plugin. See the @ghc-dump-util@\npackage for a useful command-line tool for working with dumps produced by this\nplugin.\n\n= Usage\n\n\"GhcDump.Plugin\" provides a Core-to-Core plugin which dumps a representation\nof the Core AST to a file after every Core-to-Core pass. To use it, simply\ninstall this package and add @-fplugin GhcDump.Plugin@ to your GHC\ncommand-line. See the [README](https://github.com/bgamari/ghc-dump)\nfor further analysis tips.";
