With SQS, you can offload\nthe administrative burden of operating and scaling a highly available\nmessaging cluster, while paying a low price for only what you use.\n\n/See:/ <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html AWS API Reference>\n\n/Warning:/ This is an experimental preview release which is still under\nheavy development and not intended for public consumption, caveat emptor!";
