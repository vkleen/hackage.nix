Instances are based on monad\ntransformers in @MonadTransControl@, which includes all standard monad\ntransformers in the @transformers@ library except @ContT@.\n\nSee the @lifted-base@ package which uses @monad-control@ to lift @IO@\noperations from the @base@ library (like @catch@ or @bracket@) into any monad\nthat is an instance of @MonadBase@ or @MonadBaseControl@.\n\nNote that this package is a rewrite of Anders Kaseorg's @monad-peel@\nlibrary. The main difference is that this package provides CPS style operators\nand exploits the @RankNTypes@ and @TypeFamilies@ language extensions to\nsimplify and speedup most definitions.";
