I've partially solved the problem in MIDA — program that generates\nMIDI files using very simple and symmetric language. However, even though\nMIDA is a fine tool to create scores, it's not sufficient if you want to\ncontrol everything. Initially I thought I could find some plugins that can\nalgorithmically control other plugins, but there are no decent tools of\nthis sort. How automation is handled in a traditional DAW? Well, you draw\nit in a separate track. Wouldn't it be a good idea to algorithmically\nperform exactly that: drawing of the automation track. This is simpler\nthan it may seem: many DAWs allow to export tracks in XML format, and this\nis all we need to start our hacking.";
