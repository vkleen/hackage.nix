Reserved words are @load@,\n@store@, @imm@, @loadIndex@, @shift@, @reduce@ and @broadcast@.\n\n\"Language.Paraiso.Tensor\" is the library for tensor calculus of\narbitrary rank and dimension. @Vector@ and @Axis@ are two main\nconcepts. The type @Vector@ represents rank-1 tensor, and tensors\nof higher ranks are recursively defined as @Vector@ of\n@Vector@s. With @Axis@ you can refer to the components of\n@Vector@s, compose them, or contract them. Standalone usecases of\n@Tensor@ library and other components of Paraiso are found in:\n<https://github.com/nushio3/Paraiso/tree/master/attic>\n\n* A document describing the current and the future designs :\n<https://github.com/nushio3/Paraiso/blob/master/paper/om.pdf>\n\n* Sample programs written in Paraiso :\n<https://github.com/nushio3/Paraiso/tree/master/examples>\n\n* The codes generated from the samples :\n<https://github.com/nushio3/Paraiso/tree/exampled/examples>\n\n* The wiki :\n<http://www.paraiso-lang.org/wiki/>";
