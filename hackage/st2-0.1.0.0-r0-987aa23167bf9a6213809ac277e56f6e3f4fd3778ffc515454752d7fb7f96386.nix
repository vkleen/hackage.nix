This allows\nus to define a region of the heap in more minute contours, with each state thread\nhaving explicit access to regions in memory. This is achieved using the function `runST2`,\nwhich in effects lets the user run a computation that makes use of two partially-overlapping\nmemory regions. Within that computation, the user can run sub-computations bound to one or\nthe other memory region. Furthermore, a sub-computation can move any variable that it owns\ninto the common overlap via `share`.\n\nAn example is shown in the documentation, where one sub-computation creates two cells: one\nprivate, and the other shared. A second sub-computation has unconstrained access to the\nshared cell. Yet even though the private reference is also in scope during the second\nsub-computation, any attempts to access it there will fail to compile.";
