Thanks to STM, these lists can be shared among\nthreads with little effort.\n\nSuppose you have a thread listening for events.  You want to dispatch\nevents to any thread that opts in.  You could write a function that\ninstalls an event handler, performs an action, and removes the handler:\n\n>withEventHandler list handler action =\n>    bracket (atomically \$ LinkedList.append handler list)\n>            (atomically . LinkedList.delete)\n>            (\\_ -> action)\n\nThen, you could have your listener thread dispatch events using a function\nlike this:\n\n>dispatchEvent list event = do\n>    handlers <- atomically \$ LinkedList.toList list\n>    forM_ handlers \$ \\handler -> handler event";
