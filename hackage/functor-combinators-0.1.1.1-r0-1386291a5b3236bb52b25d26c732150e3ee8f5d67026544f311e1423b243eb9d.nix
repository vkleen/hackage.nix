In the process, you can design featureful programs by\ncomposing smaller \"primitives\" using basic unversal combinators.\n\nThe main entry point is \"Data.Functor.Combinators\", but more fine-grained\nfunctionality and extra combinators (some of them re-implementations for\ncompatibility) are available in other modules as well.\n\nThis library does not define new functor combinators for the most part,\nbut rather re-exports them from different parts of the Haskell ecosystem\nand provides a uniform interface.\n\nSee the README for a quick overview, and also\n<https://blog.jle.im/entry/functor-combinatorpedia.html> for an in-depth\ndive into the motivation behind functor combinator-driven development,\nexamples of the functor combinators in this library, and details about how\nto use these abstractions!";
