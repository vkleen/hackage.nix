This allows you to use beam syntax to\nwrite type-safe schema generation code.\nThe package also provides features to introspect beam schemas,\nand support for automatic generation of migrations in SQL and\nHaskell formats.\nThis is mostly a low-level support library. Most often, this\nlibrary is used to write tooling to support DDL manipulation in\nyour project, or to enable migrations support in beam backends.\nFor a more turnkey solution for database migrations, consider\nthe <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/beam-migrate-cli beam-migrate>\ncommand line tool. This provides out-of-the-box support for migrations,\nschema change management, and version control, based on the features\nprovided in this library.";
