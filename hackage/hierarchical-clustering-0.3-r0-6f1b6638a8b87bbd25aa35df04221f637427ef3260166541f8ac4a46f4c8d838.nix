The distance between two clusters\nis calculated according to the linkage type.  The dendrogram\nrepresents not only the clusters but also the order on which\nthey were created.\n\nThis function uses a na√Øve algorithm that represents distances\nin a rectangular distance matrix.  There could be space\nimprovements (e.g. using a triangular matrix structure) and\ntime improvements (e.g. using a finger tree to avoid traversing\nthe whole matrix on every iteration just to see what the\nminimum is).\n\nChanges in version 0.3:\n\n* Added function @cutAt@.\n\n* Fixed complexity in Haddock comments.";
