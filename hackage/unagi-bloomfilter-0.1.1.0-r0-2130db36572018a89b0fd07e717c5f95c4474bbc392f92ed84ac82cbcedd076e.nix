This implementation is backed by\nSipHash so can safely consume untrusted inputs.\n\nThe implementation here compares favorably with traditional set\nimplementations in a single-threaded context, e.g. here are 10 inserts or\nlookups compared across some sets of different sizes:\n\n<<http://i.imgur.com/gei1LW4.png>>\n\nWith the llvm backend benchmarks take around 75-85% of the runtime of the\nnative code gen.\n\nUnfortunately writes in particular don't seem to scale currently; i.e.\ndistributing writes across multiple threads may be /slower/ than in a\nsingle-threaded context, because of memory effects. We plan to export\nfunctionality that would support using the filter here in a concurrent\ncontext with better memory behavior (e.g. a server that shards to a\nthread-pool which handles only a portion of the bloom array).\n\n<<http://i.imgur.com/RaUSmZB.png>>\n";
