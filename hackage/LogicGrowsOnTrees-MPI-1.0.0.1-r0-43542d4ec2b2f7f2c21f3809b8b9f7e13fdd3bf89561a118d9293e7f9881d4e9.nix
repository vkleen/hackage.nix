See the module documentation for more details.\n\nNOTE:  You need to have an MPI implementation installed to use the package;\nno thread support is required, and it only uses very simple\nfunctionality so MPI 1.0 or 1.1 should suffice. Also, @mpi.h@ needs\nto be in the include path and a library named @mpi@ (@libmpi@ in\nunix) in the library path; if these files are not in their respective\npaths, you can add their directories to their respective search paths\nfor this package by using Cabal's respective\n@--extra-include-dirs=...@ and @--extra-lib-dirs=...@ options.";
