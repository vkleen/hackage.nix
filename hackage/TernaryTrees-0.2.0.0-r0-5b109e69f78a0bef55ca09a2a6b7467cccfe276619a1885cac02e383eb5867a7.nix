This package implements a generic tree\nfor storing lists of Ord instances, and a specialised String\nimplementation which is about 30% faster than the generic version.\n\nAn example program is provided what shows how to use the package\nas a dictionary program for spell checking, and how it can be\nused to serialise data with Don Stewart's Data.Binary package.\n\nFrom my testing, using the \\/usr\\/share\\/dict\\/words file on my system\n(over 230,000 words), inserting all words, checking they all exist\nin the tree, writing them to a binary file, reading them back in\nand checking the read in result is the same as the original takes\nslightly over 3 seconds using the StringSet. The written file is\nalso slightly smaller than the input (by over 40% in some cases).\n\nNew in this version:\n\n* Added a StringMap type, which should be more efficient than using TernaryMap String a\n\n&#169; 2009 by Alex Mason (<http://random.axman6.com/blog/>).
