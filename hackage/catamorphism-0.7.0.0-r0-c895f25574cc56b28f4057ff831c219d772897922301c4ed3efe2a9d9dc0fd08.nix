      description = "This module exposes a 'makeCata' function which can create catamorphisms for\narbitrary Haskell types. Catamorphisms are functions which deconstruct some\nvalue by replacing each data constructor with a custom function yielding a\nnew value. See <http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Catamorphisms> for a more\nin-depth discussion of catamorphisms in Haskell.\n\nThe Haskell base package already comes with a couple of standard\ncatamorphisms, such as 'maybe' (for 'Maybe' values). The 'maybe' function\ncould have been generated using 'makeCata' as follows:\n\n> -- Defines 'maybe :: b -> (a -> b) -> Maybe a -> b'\n> \$(makeCata defaultOptions ''Maybe)\n\nHowever, catamorphisms are especially useful for recursive data structures.\nConsider the following simple example which defines a basic data type for\nmodelling sums of numbers, supporting variables:\n\n> import Data.Morphism.Cata\n> import Data.Maybe (fromJust)\n>\n> data Expr a = Number a\n>             | Variable Char\n>             | Sum (Expr a) (Expr a)\n>\n> -- Defines 'expr :: (a -> b) -> (Char -> b) -> (b -> b -> b) -> Expr a -> b'\n> \$(makeCata defaultOptions ''Expr)\n\nThe 'makeCata' invocation defines a 'expr' function which works like a fold on\n'Expr' values; it can be used to implement various useful other functions:\n\n> -- Evaluate an Expr, given some variable bindings\n> eval :: Num a => [(Char, a)] -> Expr a -> a\n> eval vars = expr id (fromJust . (`lookup` vars)) (+)\n>\n> -- Pretty-prints an Expr\n> pprint :: Show a => Expr a -> String\n> pprint = expr show show (\\a b -> a ++ \" + \" ++ b)\n>\n> -- Counts the number of variables used in an expr\n> numVars :: Expr a -> Int\n> numVars = expr (const 1) (const 0) (+)";
