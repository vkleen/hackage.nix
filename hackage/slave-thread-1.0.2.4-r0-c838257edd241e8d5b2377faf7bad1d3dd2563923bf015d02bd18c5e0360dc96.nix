When it dies for whatever reason (exception or finishing normally)\nit kills all the slave threads that were forked from it.\nThis protects you from ghost threads.\n\n2. It waits for all slaves to die and execute their finalizers\nbefore executing its own finalizer and getting released itself.\nThis gives you hierarchical releasing of resources.\n\n3. When a slave thread dies with an uncaught exception\nit reraises it in the master thread.\nThis protects you from silent exceptions\nand lets you be sure of getting informed\nif your program gets brought to an erroneous state.";
