      description = "An efficient compact, immutable byte string type (both strict and lazy)\nsuitable for binary or 8-bit character data.\n\nThe 'ByteString' type represents sequences of bytes or 8-bit characters.\nIt is suitable for high performance use, both in terms of large data\nquantities, or high speed requirements. The 'ByteStrin'g functions follow\nthe same style as Haskell\\'s ordinary lists, so it is easy to convert code\nfrom using 'String' to 'ByteString'.\n\nTwo 'ByteString' variants are provided:\n\n* Strict 'ByteString's keep the string as a single large array. This\nmakes them convenient for passing data between C and Haskell.\n\n* Lazy 'ByteStrings' use a lazy list of strict chunks which makes it\nsuitable for I\\/O streaming tasks.\n\nThe @Char8@ modules provide a character-based view of the same\nunderlying 'ByteString' types. This makes it convenient to handle mixed\nbinary and 8-bit character content (which is common in many file formats\nand network protocols).\n\n'ByteString's are not designed for Unicode. For Unicode strings you should\nuse the 'Text' type from the @text@ package.\n\nThese modules are intended to be imported qualified, to avoid name clashes\nwith \"Prelude\" functions, e.g.\n\n> import qualified Data.ByteString as BS";
