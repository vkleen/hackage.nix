Currently, there are two backends:\n(1) an interpreter that serves as a reference\nimplementation of the intended semantics of the\nlanguage and (2) a CUDA backend generating code for\nCUDA-capable NVIDIA GPUs.\n\nTo use the CUDA backend, you need to have CUDA version 3.x\ninstalled.  The CUDA backend still misses some features of\nthe full language; in particular, the array operations\n'replicate', 'slice', and 'foldSeg' are not yet supported.\n\nKnown bugs in this version:    http://trac.haskell.org/accelerate/query?status=new&status=assigned&status=reopened&status=closed&version=0.7.1.0&order=priority\n\n* New in 0.7.1.0: the CUDA backend and a number of scalar functions";
