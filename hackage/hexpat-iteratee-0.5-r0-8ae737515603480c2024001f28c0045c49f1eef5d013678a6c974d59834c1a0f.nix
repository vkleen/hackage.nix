      description = "This package provides chunked XML parsing using iteratees.  It is especially suited\nto implementing XML-based socket protocols, but is useful wherever lazy parsing is\nneeded on production systems where you can't tolerate the problems that come with\nHaskell's lazy I\\/O.\n\nThe XML is presented as a lazy tree, and is processed by a handler implemented using\na monad transformer called XMLT.  The resulting monad is suspended whenever it tries\nto read a part of the tree that hasn't been parsed yet, and continued as soon as it\nis available.\nThe resulting code looks and functions very much as if you were using lazy I\\/O,\nonly without the associated problems. Your handlers can have effects, yet they\ncome out in quite a functional style.\n\nBackground:  Haskell's lazy I\\/O can be problematic in some applications because it\ndoesn't handle I\\/O errors properly, and you can't predict when it will clean up its\nresources, which could result in file handles running out.";
