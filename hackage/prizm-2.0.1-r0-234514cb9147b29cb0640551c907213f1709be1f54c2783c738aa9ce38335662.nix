Specifically,\nproviding functions for transforming between different color spaces\n(@CIE@ and @sRGB@), interpolating colors and adjusting the tint,\nshade, hue, or lightness of a color.\n\nThe inspiration for this library came from a desire to blend two\ncolors represented in the @sRGB@ color space. My research about color\nblending and color space representation in the computer led me to\nthe conclusion that the @CIE L*Ch@ color space is the most effective\nfor blending because it most accurately represents how the human eye\nsees hue and therefore preserves (and blends) hue the most\naccurately.";
