For example:\n\n> import Data.ProtoLens.Setup\n> -- Here, \"src\" is the directory where .proto source files may be found\n> main = defaultMainGeneratingProtos \"src\"\n\nThen, edit the @.cabal@ file of your project to:\n\n* Specify @build-type: Custom@, and add a @custom-setup@ clause that\ndepends on @proto-lens-setup@.\n\n* List the .proto files in @extra-source-files@.  Note that the field belongs\nat the top level of the @.cabal@ file, rather than once per\nlibrary\\/executable\\/etc.\n\n* List the generated modules (e.g. @Proto.Foo.Bar@) in @exposed-modules@\nor @other-modules@ of the rule(s) that use them (e.g. the library or\nexecutables).  Additionally, add @proto-lens-runtime@ to the @build-depends@\nof those rules.\n\nFor example, in @foo-bar-proto.cabal@:\n\n> build-type: Custom\n> extra-source-files: src/foo/bar.proto\n> ...\n> custom-setup\n>   setup-depends: base, Cabal, proto-lens-setup\n\n> library\n>     exposed-modules: Proto.Foo.Bar, Proto.Foo.Bar_Fields\n>     autogen-modules: Proto.Foo.Bar, Proto.Foo.Bar_Fields\n>     build-depends: proto-lens-runtime, ...";
