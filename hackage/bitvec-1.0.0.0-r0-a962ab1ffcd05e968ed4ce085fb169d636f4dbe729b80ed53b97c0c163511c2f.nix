This is because\nnaive updates are not atomic operations: read the whole word from memory,\nmodify a bit, write the whole word back.\n* \"Data.Bit.ThreadSafe\" is slower (up to 2x), but thread-safe.\n\n=== Similar packages\n\n* [bv](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/bv)\nand [bv-little](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/bv-little)\noffer only immutable size-polymorphic bit vectors.\n@bitvec@ provides an interface to mutable vectors as well.\n\n* [array](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/array)\nis memory-efficient for 'Bool', but lacks\na handy 'Vector' interface and is not thread-safe.";
