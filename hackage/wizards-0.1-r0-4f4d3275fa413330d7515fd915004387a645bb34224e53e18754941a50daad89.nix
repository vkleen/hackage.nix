A variety of backends exist, including \"System.Console.Wizard.Haskeline\" and\n\"System.Console.Wizard.BasicIO\". It is also possible to write your own backends. While both built-in backends\noperate on a console, there is no reason why @wizards@ cannot also be used for making GUI wizard interfaces.\n\n\nSee the github page for examples on usage:\n\n<http://www.github.com/liamoc/wizards>\n\nFor creating backends, the module \"System.Console.Wizard.Internal\" has a brief tutorial.";
