This exists as a pleasant middle ground\nbetween pure functions, the ST monad and the kitchen-sink IO\nproviding a more fine-grained approach to effectful\ncomputations. Another benefit to this approach is security where a\ncomputation should only have access to resources requires to\ncomplete its job (/principle of least privilege/).\n\nThe implementation of the idea is based on Wouter Swierstra's\nFunctional Pearl /Data types a la carte/ (Journal of Functional\nProgramming, 18(4):423-436, 2008,\n<http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0956796808006758>) and uses the\n'compdata' package for compositional data types.";
