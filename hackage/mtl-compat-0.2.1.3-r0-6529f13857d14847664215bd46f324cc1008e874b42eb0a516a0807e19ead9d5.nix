If you just want\nthe @mtl@ class instances for @ExceptT@, use\n@transformers-compat@ instead, since @mtl-compat@ does nothing\nbut reexport the instances from that package.\n\nNote that unlike how @mtl-2.2@ or later works, the\n\"Control.Monad.Except\" module defined in this package exports\nall of @ExceptT@'s monad class instances. Therefore, you may\nhave to declare @import Control.Monad.Except ()@ at the top of\nyour file to get all of the @ExceptT@ instances in scope.";
