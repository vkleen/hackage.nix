A\nJava implementation of this same algorithm, by that author, is used in\nOracle's Graal project. It has also been implemented in C++ by Mozilla.\n\nThis version of the algorithm was written and verified in Coq, containing\nover 231 proved lemmas, at over 10K LOC. It was funded as a research project\nby BAE Systems (<http://www.baesystems.com>), to be used in an in-house\ncompiler written in Haskell.\n\nIn order for the Coq code to be usable from Haskell, it is first extracted\nfrom Coq as a Haskell library, during which many of Coq's fundamental types\nare mapped directly onto counterparts in the Haskell Prelude.\n\nNote that not every conceivable property of this library has been proven.\nFor some of the lower layers this is true, because the algebraic constraints\non these components could be exhaustively described in the context of their\nuse. However, higher-level components represent a great variety of use\ncases, and not every one of these cases has been proven correct. This\nrepresents an ongoing effort, with the hope that proofs will entirely\nreplace the necessity for ad hoc unit testing, and that at some point we can\nknow that any allocation produced by this library must either fail, or be\nmathematically sound. In the absence of some complete coverage, this version\nof the library provides an optional, runtime verifier to confirm\nexpectations of correctness, since it is easier to prove the validity of\ngenerated data, than of how it was generated.\n\nThis library's sole entry point is the function 'LinearScan.allocate', which\ntakes a list of basic blocks, and a functional characterization of those\nblocks, and produces a new list, with register allocations applied to their\ncomponent operations.";
