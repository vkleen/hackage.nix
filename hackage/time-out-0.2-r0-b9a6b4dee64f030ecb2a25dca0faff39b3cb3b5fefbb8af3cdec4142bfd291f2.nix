It is\nmore-or-less a lifted version of \"System.Timeout\" from the @base@ package.\nIt's good for single use, but it launches a temporary helper thread. If you\nwant to time-limit actions continuously (e.g. if you're implementing a\nnetwork protocol), you should probably use one of the other tools described\nbelow, since they use a single dedicated thread for all the timeouts.\n\n* \"Control.Timer\" - Managing a timer running in a dedicated thread. The timer\nwaits for an amount of time you specify, and then runs an action you\nspecify. You can stop and restart it at any time.\n\n* \"Control.Alarm\" - Managing an alarm, which is a timer whose action is to\nnotify your thread when the specified amount of time passes.\n\n* \"Control.Monad.Trans.Timer\" - A monad transformer for managing a timer\n\n* \"Control.Monad.Trans.Alarm\" - A monad transformer for managing an alarm\n\n* \"Control.Monad.Trans.Timeout\" - A monad transformer for running actions\nwith timeouts, useful for e.g. network protocols where any send and receive\ncan timeout\n\n* \"Control.Monad.Timeout.Class\" - A monad typeclass for running actions with\na time limit. \"Control.Timeout\" provides a simple trivial for IO (which can\nthen be used with any @MonadIO@), and \"Control.Monad.Trans.Timeout\"\nprovides a scalable instance.";
