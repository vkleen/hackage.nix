In particular, it supports strings encoded as UTF8, and BLOBs\nrepresented as ByteStrings.\nVersion 2.0 uses Text for strings instead of String.\nVersion 1.1.0.1 switches to the Faction packaging system and makes no other\nchanges.\nVersion 1.1 adds the SQLite amalgamation file (version 3.7.5) to the project, so that\nthere are no external dependencies.";
