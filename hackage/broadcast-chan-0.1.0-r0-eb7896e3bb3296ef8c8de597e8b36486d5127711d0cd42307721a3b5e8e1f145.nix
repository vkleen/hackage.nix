This presents a problem when one\nwants to have a broadcast channel that, at times, has zero listeners. To\nwrite to a 'Control.Concurrent.Chan.Chan' there must always be a read end\nand this read end will hold ALL messages alive until read.\nThe simple solution applied in this module is to separate read and write\nends. As a result, any messages written to the write end can be immediately\ngarbage collected if there are no active read ends, avoding space leaks.";
