You can build and test packages on local machine as well. For\nlocal testing, copy @packcheck.sh@ to your local machine, put it in your\nPATH, and run it from your package directory:\n\n> \$ packcheck.sh cabal-v2\n> \$ packcheck.sh stack\n\nYou can try the script on this package itself. It builds and comprehensively\nsanity tests a Haskell package across build tools (stack/cabal), uniformly,\nconsistently and across all platforms (Linux\\/MacOS\\/Windows).  You do not\nneed to be familiar with any of the build tools to use it.\n\nThis is also a minimal yet complete model package (with tests, benchmarks, CI\nalready working) that can be used as a starting point to develop a new\npackage. Beginners can use it to learn about haskell package metadata\nstructure, benchmarks, tests, CI configs etc.\n\nSee the README for comprehensive documentation.";
