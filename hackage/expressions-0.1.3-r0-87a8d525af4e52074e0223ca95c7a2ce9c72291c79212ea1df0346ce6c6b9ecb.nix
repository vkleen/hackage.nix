Common languages such as Lia and ALia\n(standard linear integer arithmetic and linear integer arithmetic with\narrays) come included.\n\nAn example of a formula declaration:\n\n> -- Let's state that zero is successor to no integer (while this would be\n> -- true for non-negative integers, stated this way it is clearly false, but\n> -- it still is a well-formed first-order statement)\n>\n> forall [var \"x\" :: Var 'IntegralSort] (cnst 0 ./=. var \"x\" .+. cnst 1) :: Lia 'BooleanSort\n\nLet's see what declarations the library rejects:\n\n> (var \"x\" :: Lia 'BooleanSort) .=.
