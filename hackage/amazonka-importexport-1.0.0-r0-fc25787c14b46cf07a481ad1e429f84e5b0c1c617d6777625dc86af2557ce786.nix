For large data sets, AWS Import\\/Export is\noften faster than Internet transfer and more cost effective than\nupgrading your connectivity.\n\nThe types from this library are intended to be used with\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka amazonka>, which provides\nmechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.\n\nUse of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.\nThis is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding\nde/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.\nThe provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries\nsuch as <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens lens> or\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core lens-family-core>.\n\nSee \"Network.AWS.ImportExport\" and the <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSImportExport/latest/DG/api-reference.html AWS API Reference>\nto get started.";
