They all return a list of semantic results,\none for each derivation. In the case that infinite derivations are possible\nonly 'good parse trees' are accepted (Ridge 2014).\nFunction parse relies on a builtin Token datatype. User-defined token-types\nare currently not supported. parseString enables parsing character strings.\nThe user is granted GLL.Combinators.Options to specify certain disambiguation\nrules.\nGLL.Combinators.MemInterface is a memoised version of the library.\nParsers are no longer pure functions and must be built inside the IO monad,\nproviding fresh memo-tables to each memo'ed non-terminal.\nSee UnitTests and MemTests for examples of using both version of\nthe library.";
