Building takes a long time\n(one module has 25.000 lines of code). Don't worry about numerous warning messages.\nUse:\n> hat-make MyProgram.hs\ntransforms and compiles all modules of your program and produces the tracing\nversion Hat/MyProgram.\nRun your program\n> Hat/MyProgram\nwhich will produce trace files MyProgram.hat*\nUse the viewing tools to explore the trace:\n> hat-trail / hat-observe / hat-explore /...   MyProgram\nThere is documentation in the \"docs\" folder, but much of it is outdated.\nThere are a few small programs for exploring tracing in the \"examples\" folder.";
