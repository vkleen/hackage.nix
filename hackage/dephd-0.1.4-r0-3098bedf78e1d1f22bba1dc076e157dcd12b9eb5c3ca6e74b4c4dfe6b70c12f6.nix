Can also read FASTA with an\nassociated quality file.\n\nCan trim according to Lucy or Phred parameters, can mask by quality, can plot\ngraphs (via gnuplot) of sequence quality to a window, or to JPG/EPS files.  Can\ncategorize sequences according to overall quality.  Also constructs files suitable for\nsubmission to dbEST.  More information at <http://blog.malde.org/index.php/2010/09/07/submitting-ests-upstream/>.\n\nAlso provides 'fakequal', a utility to generate bogus quality values,\nwhich are sometimes needed by less flexible tools.\n\nThe Darcs repository is at <http://malde.org/~ketil/biohaskell/dephd>.";
