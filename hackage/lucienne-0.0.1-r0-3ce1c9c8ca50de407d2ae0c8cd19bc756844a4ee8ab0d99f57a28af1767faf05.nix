A running mongoDB (<http://www.mongodb.org>) serves as database backend.\n\n/Installing instructions:/\n\n1. Run a mongoDB instance\n\n2. @cabal install@ this package. This will result in two executables: @lucienne@ and @lucienne-fetch@.\n\n3. Run @lucienne@. You might want to limit the maximum heap size,\ne.g. @lucienne +RTS -M30m@\n\n4. Run @lucienne-fetch@ periodically (e.g. by a cron job)\n\nLucienne accepts the following options:\n\n> lucienne:\n>   -p PORT  --port=PORT          Port of incoming requests\n>   -d HOST  --databaseHost=HOST  Database host\n>   -e PORT  --databasePort=PORT  Database port\n>   -h       --help               Print this help";
