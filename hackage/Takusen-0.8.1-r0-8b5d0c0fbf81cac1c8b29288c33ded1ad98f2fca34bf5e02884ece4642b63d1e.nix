Takusen can avoid loading the whole result\nset in memory, and so can handle queries returning millions of rows in\nconstant space. Takusen also supports automatic marshalling and\nunmarshalling of results and query parameters. These benefits come\nfrom the design of query result processing around a left-fold\nenumerator.\n\nCurrently we fully support ODBC, Oracle, Sqlite, and PostgreSQL.";
