Also, the packet switching is currently\nimplemented using Data.List.lookup as opposed to something\nmore appropriate. This really isn't much of a problem until\nyou hit hundreds or thousands of peers.\n\nRequires a TAP-Win32 driver to run in Windows. Requires the tun\nmodule to be loaded to run in Linux (expects \\/dev\\/net\\/tun).";
