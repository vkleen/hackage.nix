This could be used to implement a\nfully-fledged game client, or a playtak.com bot.\nPlayTakBot is a framework to make it easy to build a playtak.com bot. It will\nmaintain a connection, seek games, and create a game tree. The bot implementor\njust needs to provide functions to evaluate a game state, and choose the next\nplay from each game state.";
