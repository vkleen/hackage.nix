The library uses aggressive\ninlining and MutableByteArray#s internally, so it is very\nefficient.\n\nThe main utility of the library is converting between the linear\nrepresentation of a permutation and a sequence of swaps.  This\nallows, for instance, applying a permutation or its inverse\nto an array with O(1) memory use.\n\nMuch of the interface for the library is based on the permutation\nand combination functions in the GNU Scientific Library (GSL).\n";
