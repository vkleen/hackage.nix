You can build your own stack to highly tailor the behaviour to your needs, starting with such simple things, like logging messages to a list, ending on logging compile-time, priority-filtered messages from different threads and gathering them in other logger thread.\n\nFor detailed documentation and examples look at the ''System.Log'' module.";
