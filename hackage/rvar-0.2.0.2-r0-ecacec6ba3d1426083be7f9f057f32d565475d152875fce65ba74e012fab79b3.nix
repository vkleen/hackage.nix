Quality is prioritized over speed,\nbut performance is an important goal too.\n\nIn my testing, I have found it capable of speed\ncomparable to other Haskell libraries, but still\na fair bit slower than straight C implementations of\nthe same algorithms.\n\nChanges in 0.2.0.1:  Version bump for transformers\ndependency.";
