The library stands out in not\nbeing based on the continuation monad. Rather, the monad of \"Control.Monad.CC.CCExc\"\nis an extension of the 'Error' monad: a monad for restartable exceptions.\nThe library offers not one monad transformer but a family ('CC' 'p')\nparameterized by the prompt flavor 'p' . The library defines several prompt\nflavors; the users are welcome to define their own.\n\nSee the original article at <http://okmij.org/ftp/continuations/implementations.html#CC-monads>\nfor more information.\n\nThis package split multi-prompt delimited control from\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/liboleg> for usability.";
