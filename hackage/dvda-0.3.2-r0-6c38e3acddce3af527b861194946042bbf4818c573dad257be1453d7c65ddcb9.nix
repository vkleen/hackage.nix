Expressions can be turned into\ncomputational graphs (@FunGraph@s) using toFunGraph. This uses unsafe reification for performance reasons,\nand explicit common subexpression elimination using hashing can be performed using `Dvda.CSE`\n\n@FunGraph@s can be converted to C code and MATLAB mex functions. In the future there will be JIT compilation\nso you can call these functions efficiently from Haskell.\n\nPretty graphviz plots!\n\nTo get started check out the source for `Dvda.Examples`";
