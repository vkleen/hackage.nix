A\nnumber of plugins offer docset lookup in editors such as Emacs and\nVim.  By using this tool, one can convert haskell package haddock(s)\nto docsets.\n\nThe major benefit of dash-haskell, is that once these docsets are\nbuilt, dash tools provide one of the few, if only solutions for\noffline, contextual, and project dependency approximate IDE\ndocumentation for Haskell.\n\nUsage Examples:\n\n>\$ dash-haskell parsec-3.1.5\n\nbuilds:\n\n>./docsets/parsec-3.1.5.docset\n\n>\$ dash-haskell -c foo.cabal -s\n\nbuilds all packages listed as dependencies in the cabal file, using the\ndefault db ordering (global, sandbox, user).\n\nNote: haddock documentation for the package must first be built prior to calling dash-haskell on it, e.g.\n\n>\$ cabal install --only-dependencies --enable-documentation\n\nVersions:\n\nThe version numbering scheme for this package is defined as follows, given:\n\n>dash-haskell-a.b.c.d\n\na, b index interface or feature changes to the CLI\n\nc, d index bug-fix and documentation updates\n";
