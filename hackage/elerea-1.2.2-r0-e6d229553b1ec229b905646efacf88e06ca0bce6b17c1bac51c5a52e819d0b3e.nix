Reactivity\nis provided through various higher-order constructs that also allow\nthe user to work with arbitrary time-varying structures containing\nlive signals.\n\nStateful signals can be safely generated at any time through a\nspecialised monad, while stateless combinators can be used in a\npurely applicative style.  Elerea signals can be defined recursively,\nand external input is trivial to attach.  A unique feature of the\nlibrary is that cyclic dependencies are detected on the fly and\nresolved by inserting delays dynamically, unless the user does it\nexplicitly.\n\nThis is a minimal library that defines only some basic primitives,\nand you are advised to install @elerea-examples@ as well to get an\nidea how to build non-trivial systems with it.  The examples are\nseparated in order to minimise the dependencies of the core library.";
