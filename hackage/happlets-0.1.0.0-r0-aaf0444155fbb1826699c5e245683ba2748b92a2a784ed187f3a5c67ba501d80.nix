      description = "\nThis package is provides the Happlets API that is common to all Happlet\nback-end provider libraries. Along with this package, it is necessary to\ninstall a back-end library such as 'happlets-lib-gtk'.  Currently Gtk+\nversion 2 with a Cairo-based canvas is the only back-end available. Gtk+\nversion 3, Xlib, SDL2, GLUT, and (possibly) Wayland back-ends are all\nfeasible and may be implemented in the future.\n\nThe goal of the Happlets project is to allow you to create very simple,\nthread-safe applications that contain nothing more than a single window\nwith a drawing canvas that can respond to user input events, like mouse\nclicks, key-presses, or frame animation events. The intention is to\ncreate a minimal programming platform for small, single-purpose\ngraphical applications which simply displays some interactive graphic,\nfor example a plot of some data, or a simple game. Naturally, the\nHapplet program can be arbitrarily complex, but it may be better to\nconsider other, FRP-based solutions if managing events becomes too\ndifficult.\n\nA happlet back-end provider may provide additional widget API functions,\nbut using these APIs will result in your applet being dependent on the\nspecific back-end and will thus not be as portable as programming for\nthe \"happlets\" package alone. Happlets aims to achieve a balance between\nbeing as minimal as possible, but still provide enough graphics drawing\nprimitives to be useful for the widest range of possible applications.\n\nThe Gtk+ v2 back-end provider can be downloaded from this link:\n\nhttps://hackage.haskell.org/package/happlets-lib-gtk\n";
