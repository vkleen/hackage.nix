Many a brave\nlambda-knight strove to add such a function, but\ntheir striving was in vain, for Lo, the Supreme\nCouncil fell to bickering amongst themselves what\nwas to be the essential nature of the One True\nFunction which could cleave a list in twain (or\nthrain, or any required number of parts).\n\nAnd thus came to pass the split package,\ncomprising divers functions for splitting a list\nasunder, each according to its nature.  And the\nSupreme Council had no longer any grounds for\nargument, for the favored method of each was\ncontained therein.\n\nTo get started, see the \"Data.List.Split\" module.";
