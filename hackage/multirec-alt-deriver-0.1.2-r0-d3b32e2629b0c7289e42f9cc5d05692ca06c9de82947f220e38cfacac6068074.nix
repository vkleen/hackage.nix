In other words, a proof now doesn't need to have the same name as the type whose family-membership it proves anymore. This is useful if you're working with existing code where the type's name is already taken on the value level.\n\n- The names of the constructor-representing empty types are also customizable now.\n\n- The type sums in the pattern functor are now /balanced/ trees of @(:+:)@ rather than right-nested lists. This cuts down the size of the value-level code (and hopefully helps with compilation time).";
