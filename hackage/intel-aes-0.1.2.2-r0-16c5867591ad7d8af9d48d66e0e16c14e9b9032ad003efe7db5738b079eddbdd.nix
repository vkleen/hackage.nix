Plus,\nstatistically sound, splittable random number generation based on AES.\nThis package is nothing more than a wrapper around the Intel-provided\nAESNI sample library which also includes a portable software\nimplementation of AES by Brian Gladman.  It contains C,\nassembly, and Haskell sources.  And it includes prebuilt dynamic\nlibraries to make the build process less fragile.\n(Rebuilding requires the @yasm@ assembler.)  But prebuilt shared\nlibraries are not included for all platforms yet.  (Volunteers\nneeded!)\nFinally, note that this package is currently triggering some haddock\nproblems.
