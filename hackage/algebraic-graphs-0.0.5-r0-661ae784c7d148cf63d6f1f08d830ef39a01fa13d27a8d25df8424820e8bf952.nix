See <https://github.com/snowleopard/alga-paper this paper>\nfor the motivation behind the library, the underlying theory and implementation details.\n\nThe top-level module\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/algebraic-graphs/docs/Algebra-Graph.html Algebra.Graph>\ndefines the core data type\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/algebraic-graphs/docs/Algebra-Graph.html#t:Graph Graph>,\nwhich is a deep embedding of four graph construction primitives /empty/,\n/vertex/, /overlay/ and /connect/. More conventional graph representations can be found in\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/algebraic-graphs/docs/Algebra-Graph-AdjacencyMap.html Algebra.Graph.AdjacencyMap>\nand\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/algebraic-graphs/docs/Algebra-Graph-Relation.html Algebra.Graph.Relation>.\n\nThe type classes defined in\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/algebraic-graphs/docs/Algebra-Graph-Class.html Algebra.Graph.Class>\nand\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/algebraic-graphs/docs/Algebra-Graph-HigherKinded-Class.html Algebra.Graph.HigherKinded.Class>\ncan be used for polymorphic graph construction and manipulation. Also see\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/algebraic-graphs/docs/Algebra-Graph-Fold.html Algebra.Graph.Fold>\nthat defines the Boehm-Berarducci encoding of algebraic graphs and provides additional\nflexibility for polymorphic graph manipulation.\n\nThis is an experimental library and the API will be unstable until version 1.0.0.
