With this library,\nyou specify a list of modules that plugin should be forced\nto import (i.e., some plugin API module), and a list of\nmodule that you want to allow plugin to import (some\n`surely safe' modules). Plugin cannot import any other\nmodules. Moreover, you can specify some language\nextensions, for example, NoImplicitPrelude.";
