      description = "\"Prelude.EDSL\" exports a small subset of the \"Prelude\":\nsome standard types and classes plus a small number of\nconvenience functions.\n\nThe motivation for this module is that it is common for\ndeeply embedded domain-specific languages (EDSLs) to\nredefine identifiers from the \"Prelude\", so EDSL users must\nhide the \"Prelude\" in their programs. However, there are\ncertain useful things from the \"Prelude\" that are usually\nnot redefined -- function composition being one example --\nso it becomes quite awkward to have to hide everything from\nthe \"Prelude\".\n\nThe reason for exporting e.g the @Num@ class but not @Ord@\nis that it is possible to give an instance for deep\nembeddings of the former but not the latter. For example,\nassuming @Exp@ is the type of a deep embedding, we can have\n\n> (+) :: Exp -> Exp -> Exp\n\nbut not\n\n> (<) :: Exp -> Exp -> Exp\n\n(because @(<)@ has a @Bool@ result, regardless of the type\nof the arguments).";
