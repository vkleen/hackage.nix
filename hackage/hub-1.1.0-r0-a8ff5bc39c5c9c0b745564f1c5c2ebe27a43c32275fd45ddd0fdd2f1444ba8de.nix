Commands are provided for\n(re)naming, annotating, replicating, swapping, archiving,\nlocking and removing hubs. E.g.,\n\n> hub init\n\nwill create a hub based on the default GHC installation\nand associate the current directory with it. Any use\nof /cabal/ or the GHC tools within this directory or it's\ndescendants will work with correct tool chain and the\nprivate user-package database belonging to the hub.\n\nThe following would (i) download 'hexpat' (ii) install it\nin a named 'hexpat-test' hub connected to the /2011.2.0.1/\nHaskell Platform, (iii) build the 'hexpat' test suite\nwith the same hub, and (iv) finally run the test suite.\n\n>cabal unpack hexpat\n>cd hexpat-*\n>hub init -s 2011.2.0.1 hexpat-test\n>cabal install\n>cd test\n>cabal install --bindir=.\n>./testsuite\n\nThis same 'hexpat-test' hub can be shared with other\nwork trees.\n\nThe tool is intended to be provided as part of a\ndistribution (like the /JustHub/ Enterprise Linux\ndistribution) but it can be configured with existing\nstock GHC installations without too much effort.  Once\ninstalled and configured the hub command  inter-operates\nseamlessly with the GHC tools (/ghc/, /ghci/, /ghc-pkg/,\netc.) and /Cabal-install/.\n\nFor installation instructions, introductory material,\nFAQs, etc., see the home page http:\\/\\/justhub.org.";
