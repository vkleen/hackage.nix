On\nthe other hand, it has a combination of features I was\nunable to find in other libraries:\n* Keys and values are parsed with configurable parsec\nparsers, resulting in flexible syntax and pretty error\nmessages.\n* Custom parsers can be created with parsec to handle\nvalues of any type.\n* Keys that aren't explicitly handled result in parse\nerrors.\nIf you don't need all of these features, there are\nprobably better libraries out there for you. If you're free\nto use its idiosyncratic file format, the config-value\nlibrary, in particular, is excelent.";
