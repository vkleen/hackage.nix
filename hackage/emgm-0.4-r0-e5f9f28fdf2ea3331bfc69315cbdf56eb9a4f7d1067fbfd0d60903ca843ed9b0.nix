      description = "EMGM is a general-purpose library for datatype-generic programming.\n\nThe design is based on the idea of modeling algebraic datatypes as\nsum-of-product structures. Many datatypes can be modeled this way, and\nbecause they all share a common structure, we can write generic functions that\nwork on this structure.\n\nThe primary features of the library are:\n\n* /A foundation for building generic functions./ EMGM includes a collection of\ndatatypes (e.g. sum, product, and unit) and type classes (e.g. @Generic@ and\n@Rep@). Everything you need for defining generic functions and supporting\ndatatypes can be found here.\n\n* /Many useful generic functions./ These provide a wide range of\nfunctionality. For example, there is @crush@, a generalization of the\nfoldl/foldr functions, that allows you to flexibly extract the elements of a\npolymorphic container. Now, you can do many of the operations with your\ncontainer that were previously only available for lists.\n\n* /Support for standard datatypes./ EMGM supports standard types: primitives\n(e.g. @Int@ and @Float@), @Bool@, lists, tuples, @Maybe@, etc.\n\n/NOTE:/ As of version 0.4, this library does not have Template Haskell for\ngenerating the representation. We are working on another library for a\nsolution to this problem.";
