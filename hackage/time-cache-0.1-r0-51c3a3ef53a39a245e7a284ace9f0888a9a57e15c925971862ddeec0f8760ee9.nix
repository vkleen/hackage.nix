The action cares about the current minute, and doesn't\ncare about seconds or milliseconds at all. Instead of reading and formatting\nthe time many times, using this library you can keep a cache which updates\nevery minute (or other interval) and allows your application to scale without\ntime reading and formatting ever becoming a bottleneck.\n\nThere are 2 modules provided. I suggest you start with the monadic one,\nespecially for simple usage, and switch to the other one if you need\nsome custom solution.\n\nThe \"Data.Time.Cache\" module allows you to create a time caching action which\nreturns time and a formatted time string. But instead of directly reading the\ntime and running a formatter, it takes the values from a cache it\nperiodically updates.\n\nThe \"Control.Monad.Trans.Time\" module provides a convenient monadic wrapper\nfor the time cache.\n\nIf you need the time cache in multiple threads, you can create the time\ngetter once and then pass to all the threads to share.";
