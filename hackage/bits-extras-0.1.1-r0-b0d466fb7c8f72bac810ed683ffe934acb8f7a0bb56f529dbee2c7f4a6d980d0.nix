A possible workaround for GHCi on a linux\nsystem: @ln -s \\/lib\\/libgcc_s.so.1 \\/lib\\/libgcc_s.so@. Let me know about\nany other solutions to this issue for GHCi. Regular GHC compilation uses the\nsystem linker with soname support and does not run into this issue.\n\nRelevant Hackage tickets:\n\n* <http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/3563>\n\n* <http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/4102>";
