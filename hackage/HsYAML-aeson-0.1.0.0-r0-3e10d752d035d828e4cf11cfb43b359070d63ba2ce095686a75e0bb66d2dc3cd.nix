To this end this module provides a\ncompatibility layer atop [HsYAML](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/HsYAML)\nwhich allows decoding YAML documents in the more limited JSON data-model while also providing\nconvenience by reusing [aeson](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson)'s\n'FromJSON' instances for decoding the YAML data into native Haskell data types.";
