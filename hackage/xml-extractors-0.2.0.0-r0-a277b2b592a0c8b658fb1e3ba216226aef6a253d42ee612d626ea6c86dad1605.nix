You can parse an xml string into a generic xml tree\nrepresentation. Then to extract information from that tree and into\nyou own data types you can use this library.\n\nIf there is an error during extraction (expected information is\nabsent or wrong), you will get an error value with position information.\n\n= Some limitations\n\n* Only handles unqualified names, so far.\n\n* No column or line number reference in error values.";
