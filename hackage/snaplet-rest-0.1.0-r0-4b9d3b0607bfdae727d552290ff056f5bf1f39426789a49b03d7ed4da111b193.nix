This 'partial' type\nindicates what properties to change: either the name, the age, or both.\n\n> data UserPart = UserPart (Maybe String) (Maybe Int)\n\nThis type also acts as a search mechanism: we can search by names, ages, or\nboth.  We can use either a username or a @UserPart@ search to find users, and\ndefine a function to convert URL query string parameters to this search.\n\n> type UserId = Either Username UserPart\n>\n> userIdFromParams :: Params -> Maybe UserId\n\nNow we have the pieces required to define our CRUD behaviour.\n\n> createUser :: User -> AppHandler ()\n>\n> readUser :: UserId -> AppHandler [User]\n>\n> updateUser :: UserId -> UserPart -> AppHandler Bool\n>\n> deleteUser :: UserId -> AppHandler Bool\n\nIf we've implemented Aeson instances, we can add JSON as a media format\nwithout having to define these manually.  Once the behaviour is attached to\nthe resource, it can be served in the handler.\n\n> serveUser :: AppHandler ()\n> serveUser = serveResource \$ resource\n>     & addMedia jsonInstances\n>     & setCreate createUser\n>     & setRead readUser\n>     & setUpdate updateUser\n>     & setDelete deleteUser\n>     & setFromParams userIdFromParams";
