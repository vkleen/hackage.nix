The ClassLaws library is a framework that\nsupports testing such class laws using QuickCheck.  Our framework is\na light-weight class law testing framework, which requires a limited\namount of work per class law, and per datatype for which the class\nlaw is tested.  We also show how to test class laws with\npartially-defined values.  Using partially-defined values, we show\nthat the standard lazy and strict implementations of the state monad\ndo not satisfy the expected laws.
