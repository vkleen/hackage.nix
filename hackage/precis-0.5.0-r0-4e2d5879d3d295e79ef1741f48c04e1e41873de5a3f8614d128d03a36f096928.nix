Version 0.5.0 does have a better strategy\nto resolve conditional modules, but otherwise it is not a\ncompelling upgrade. If you have 0.4.0 installed, I recommend\nyou skip this revision and wait for the next version.\n\nCHANGES\n0.4.0 to 0.5.0\n\n* Major re-organization. Module-to-file resolution substantially\nchanged. Should be better for Cabal fines that use condition\nvariables.\n\n0.3.1 to 0.4.0\n\n* Substantial changes to reporting - now a summary is printed\nto the console, and an HTML report can be generated via a\ncommand line flag.\n\n* Changed constructor names for Edit data type\n";
