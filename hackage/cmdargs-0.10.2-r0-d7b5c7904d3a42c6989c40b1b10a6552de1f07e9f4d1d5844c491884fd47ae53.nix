Most users\nwill want to use the \"System.Console.CmdArgs.Implicit\" module, whose\ndocumentation contains an example.\n\n* \"System.Console.CmdArgs.Explicit\" provides a way to write command line\nparsers for both single mode programs (most programs) and multiple\nmode programs (e.g. darcs or cabal). Parsers are defined by constructing\na data structure.\n\n* \"System.Console.CmdArgs.Implicit\" provides a way to concisely define\ncommand line parsers, up to three times shorter than getopt. These parsers\nare translated into the Explicit data type.\n\n* \"System.Console.CmdArgs.GetOpt\" provides a wrapper allowing compatiblity\nwith existing getopt parsers, mapping to the Explicit data type.\n\nFor a general reference on what command line flags are commonly used,\nsee <http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/ch10s05.html>.";
