It provides the following conveniences on top of\nthose libraries:\n\n- A set of shorter functions to type: 'debug', 'log', 'warn', plus others\nthat flush after each message, or which allow providing a message source\nstring.\n\n- Logging variants of 'error', 'trace' and 'traceShow', called 'errorL',\n'traceL' and 'traceShowL'.  These use 'unsafePerformIO' in order to act as\ndirect replacements, so the usual caveats apply.\n\n- A global function, 'setDebugLevel', which uses a global 'IORef' to record\nthe logging level, saving you from having to carry around the notion of\n\"verbosity level\" in a Reader environment.\n\n- A set of \"timed\" variants, 'timedLog' and 'timedDebug', which report how\nlong the specified action took to execute in wall-clock time.";
