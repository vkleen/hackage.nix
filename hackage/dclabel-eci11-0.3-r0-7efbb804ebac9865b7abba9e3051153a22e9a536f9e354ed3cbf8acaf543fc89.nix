This package is intended to only be used at the computer science school ECI 2011 (Buenos Aires, Argentina) <http://www.dc.uba.ar/events/eci/2011/index_html>. Please, refer to the official release of dclabels if you plan to use it for other purposes.\nThe /DC Label/ (DCLabel) library provides dynamic information\nflow control label format in the form of conjunctions of\ndisjunctions of principals. Most code should import module\n\"DCLabel.Safe\"; trusted code should import \"DCLabel.TCB\".\nThe core functionality of the library is documented in\n\"DCLabel.Core\", while the small EDSL used to create labels is\ndocumented in \"DCLabel.NanoEDSL\". DCLabel was implemented by David\nMazieres (<http://www.scs.stanford.edu/~dm/>), Deian Stefan\n(<http://www.scs.stanford.edu/~deian/>), and Alejandro Russo\n(<http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~russo/>).\nTo obtain the latest experimental source code, run:\n@git clone http:\\/\\/www.scs.stanford.edu\\/~deian\\/dclabel.git@";
