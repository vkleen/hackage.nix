Therefore, it can be used in very time consuming computations such are CPU intensive calculations\nor procedures that are most of the time waiting for the action of a process or an user, that are prone to comunication\nfailures, timeouts or shutdowns.\n\nThe computantion can be restarted at the interrupted point thanks to its logged state in permanent storage.\nBesides that, the package also provides other services associated to workflows\n\nNew in this release,\n\n* 0.6.0.0 Changes in ghc 7.4 forces to drop the abstract serializer\nnow Text and  binary versions are the same.\nFor binary serialization, use 'showBinary' and 'readpBinary'\n\n* 0.5.8.2 minor changes for the MFlow package\n\n* 0.5.8.1 solved a bug that caused a \"casting failure\"\n\n* 0.5.8:\n\n*registerType is no longer needed\n\n* Configurable state persistence (for example, in databases) . Default in files\n\n* Added Data.Binary  serialization (Use `Control.Workflow.Binary`) besides Text serialization  (`Control.Wokflow.Text`)\n\n* New simpler and more intuitive workflow  primitives with excepion handling\n\n* Instances of classes in Control.Concurrent.MonadIO, MonadCatchIO\n\n* An EDSL of workflow patterns. To express  bifurcations, confluences, timeouts etc\n\n* References to  workflow objects, that can be accessed externally: WFRef's\n\nPrevious versions:\n\n* Persisten communications facilities trough persistent data objects, inspection of workflow states ,  persistent  queues, persistent timeouts and, new in this release, References to internal workflow objects WFRef's\n\n* workflow management and monitoring, view workflow history and intermediate results.";
