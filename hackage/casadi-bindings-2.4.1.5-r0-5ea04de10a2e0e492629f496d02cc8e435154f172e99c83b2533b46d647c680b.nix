MAKE SURE pkg-config CAN FIND THE CASADI INSTALLATION, AS THIS IS HOW CABAL FINDS CASADI!!\n\nThen cabal install this package:\n\n>> cabal update && cabal install casadi-bindings\n\nIf you are upgrading this package and see linker errors, you may need to first manually `ghc-pkg unregister casadi-bindings-internal`.\n\nTemporary note: there is something wrong with casadi and ipopt related to http://list.coin-or.org/pipermail/ipopt/2014-April/003670.html, and https://github.com/casadi/casadi/issues/1075.
