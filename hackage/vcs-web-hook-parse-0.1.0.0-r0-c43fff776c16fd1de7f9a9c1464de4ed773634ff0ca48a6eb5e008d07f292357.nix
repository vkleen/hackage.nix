Then you can run a server which receives these messages and\nreports them to IRC or a mailing list (or anything else you like).\n\nThis package collects development platform specific types, and functions\nwhich parse the HTTP message bodies into values of these types. Then an\nactual web hook handler can be written using them.\n\nWhy have a single package which handles the various platforms? First, because\nparsing some JSON or XML structures is a simple task requiring very little\ncode (thanks to awesome Haskell libraries), sometimes hardly worth having its\nown dedicated package. Second, having them all here may allow sharing types\nand perhaps even developing some common web hook formats in the future.\n\nThis package handles only /free-as-in-freedom/ development platforms. In\nparticular, it means g1thub won't be supported (until it becomes free too),\nwhile support for all free platforms (DarcsDen, Gogs, Kallithea, GitLab's\n\"community edition\", etc.) is very welcome.";
