Note that no attempt has been made\nto preserve the old internal modules,  so code that\nhas these dependencies cannot use this interface.\n\nNew code should,  for the most part,  use the new\ninterface.   However, this module does implement\na chunked HTTP encoding,  which is not otherwise\nimplemented (yet?) with the new builder.";
