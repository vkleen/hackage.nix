The specification tells Green Card\nwhat (Haskell) type you want to give the function together with details\nof how the arguments (and results) to the Haskell function should\nbe marshalled to and from the data representation used by the external function.\nGreen Card will then generate gobs of low-level boilerplate code that\ntakes care of all the details.\n\nThis package supplies the executable, 'greencard', which needs GHC.\nFor the Foreign.GreenCard library, you need to install this first and then you can\ninstall greencard-lib (greencard-lib requires the greencard binary already installed).";
