We provide a high-level interface (see module\n\"Crypto.Skein\") to some of the Skein use cases.  We also\nprovide a low-level interface (see module\n\"Crypto.Skein.Internal\") should you need to use Skein in a\ndifferent way.\n\nCurrently we have support for Skein as cryptographic hash\nfunction as Skein as a message authentication code\n(Skein-MAC).
