The algorithm work on an algebraic\nring structure that is instanciated as required. This\nprelimenary release contains the minimum-free energy version\nonly.\n\n- Do not expect good runtimes with anything less than\n6.13.201008xx. The newest head produces an executable roughly\n20x faster than GHC 6.12.3.\n- Bugs are likely present in this algorithm. If you find one,\nplease send me a mail.\n- One goal is to get the vector library to optimise the loops\n(fold's) in such a way as to get performance close to the\nViennaRNA package. Right now, we are about 15x slower.\n- Works well with -Odph, -fllvm (llvm is about 70% faster than\n-fasm)";
