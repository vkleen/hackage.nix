It seems\nthat CC-delcont-exc's  Control.Monad.CC.CCExc is faster at delimited control but\nimposes more overhead on the conventional code; \"Control.Monad.CC.CCCxe\" is dual.\nIt pays to use \"Control.Monad.CC.CCCxe\" in code with long stretches of determinism\npunctuated by fits and restarts.\n\nSee the original article at <http://okmij.org/ftp/continuations/implementations.html#CC-monads>\nfor more information.\n\nThis package split multi-prompt delimited control from\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/liboleg> for usability.";
