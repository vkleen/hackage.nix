If\nthe length is already a multiple of the block size,\nan entire block size worth of padding is added.\nThe padding bytes are all set to the number of\npadding bytes. Returning to the previous example, the\npadding string would be three bytes of the byte 0x03.\nUnpadding checks the length and padding, and if\nthis is valid, strips off the padding.";
