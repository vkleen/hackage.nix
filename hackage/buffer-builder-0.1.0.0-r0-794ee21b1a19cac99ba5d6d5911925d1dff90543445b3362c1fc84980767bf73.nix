Early benchmarks show it\nis over twice as fast as ByteString Builder, primarily because\n'BufferBuilder' is built upon an ST-style restricted monad and\nmutable state instead of ByteString Builder's monoidal AST.\n\nInternally, BufferBuilder is backed by a few C functions.\nExamination of GHC's output shows nearly optimal code generation\nwith no intermediate thunks -- and thus, continuation passing and\nits associated indirect jumps and stack traffic only occur when\nBufferBuilder is asked to append a non-strict ByteString.\n\nI benchmarked four major implementations and benchmarked with the buildURL benchmark:\n\n* State monad, concatenating ByteStrings: __6.98 us__\n\n* State monad, ByteString Builder: __2.48 us__\n\n* Crazy explicit RealWorld baton passing with unboxed state: __28.94 us__ (GHC generated really awful code for this, but see the revision history for the technique)\n\n* C + FFI + ReaderT: __1.11 us__\n\nUsing BufferBuilder is very simple:\n\n> import qualified Data.BufferBuilder as BB\n>\n> let byteString = BB.runBufferBuilder \$ do\n>       BB.appendBS \"http\"\n>       BB.appendChar8 '/'\n>       BB.appendBS \"//\"";
