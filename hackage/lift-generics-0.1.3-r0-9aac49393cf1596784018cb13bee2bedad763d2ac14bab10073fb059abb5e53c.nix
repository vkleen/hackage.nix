See the\ndocumentation in the \"Language.Haskell.TH.Lift.Generics\" module\nto get started.\n\nCredit goes to Matthew Pickering for\n<https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/1830#comment:12 suggesting this idea>.\n\nNote that due to API limitations, \"GHC.Generics\" wasn't powerful\nenough to come up with the entirety of a `lift` implementation prior\nto GHC 8.0. For this reason, @genericLiftWithPkg@ requires you to\nproduce the package name yourself, which proves to be no small feat\n(see the documentation for more info).\n\nLuckily, you don't have to jump through as many hoops on GHC 8.0 and\nlater: simply use the @genericLift@ function, and life is good.";
