The units defined are fully extensible, and need not relate\nto physical properties. In fact, the core package defines only one built-in\nunit: Scalar. The package supports defining multiple inter-convertible units,\nsuch as Meter and Foot. When extracting a number from a dimensioned quantity,\nthe desired unit must be specified, and the value is converted into that unit.\nThe Haddock documentation is insufficient for using the units package.
