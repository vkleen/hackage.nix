It is extensible\nto any string type, with @String@, @ByteString@ and @Text@ provided out of the box.\n\nThe emphasis is on speed and simplicity. If you want more complete and powerful\nXML libraries, consider using /HaXml/ or /HXT/ instead.\n\nNote that /hexpat/ has undergone a major API change since 0.3.x.\n\nBenchmark results on ghc 6.10.1 against HaXml for parsing a 4K xml file with non-threading runtime:\nHAXML: 2631 us, HEXPAT: low-level parse-no tree: 243 us, lazy-String: 1240 us,\nlazy-Text: 782 us, strict-String: 1125 us, strict-Text: 770 us\n\nWith -threaded:\nHAXML: 2667 us, HEXPAT: low-level parse-no tree: 472 us,\nlazy-String: 1453 us, lazy-Text: 1057 us, strict-String: 1342 us,\nstrict-Text: 943 us";
