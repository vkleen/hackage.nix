Although\ninteraction with filesystem is required, whole interface (with exception of\ninitialization) is pure and safe as long as no external manipulation with\nused database files happens while the program is running.\nBecause only actual data, not indices (in Data.Map.Map, for example), are\nswapped and some accounting information are remembered for each item, this\nsystem is suitable mainly for situations where values are considerably\nlarger then indices. Furthermore, creating complete snapshots to a file of\nthis structure is supported; such snapshot can be then loaded, with\nindividual values being read as they are requested.\nThis package uses the Tokyo Cabinet <http://fallabs.com/tokyocabinet/>\ndatabase, which needs to be installed on the system.\nA prototype of another data structure, SwapMap, is available in the git\nrepository. It is similar to the Data.Map.Map and like Swapper allows\ntransparent swapping of data to disk, but without requiring any accessory\nfunction and with the ability to swap both elements and indices. This one\nis, however, not complete and thus not provided here.";
