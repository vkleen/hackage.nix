Specifically, the notion of the FIT \\\"profile\\\" is\nignored entirely, so to make use of the decoded file you'll need to reference the\n\\\"Profile.xls\\\" spreadsheet in the <http://www.thisisant.com/resources/fit FIT SDK>.\n\nThe \"Fit\" module exports a convenient set of data types for examining FIT files, as\nwell as some lenses for extracting specific data. It's intended that the API in the\n\"Fit\" module should be sufficient and convenient for most uses, but if you need access\nto the exact structure of the file you can use the data types in \"Fit.Internal.FitFile\"\nand parsers in \"Fit.Internal.Parse\".\n\nFeel free to contact me if you have any questions, suggestions, or requests.";
