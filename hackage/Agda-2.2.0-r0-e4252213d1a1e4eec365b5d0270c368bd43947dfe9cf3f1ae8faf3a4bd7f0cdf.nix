It also has parameterised\nmodules, mixfix operators, Unicode characters, and an interactive\nEmacs interface (the type checker can assist in the development of\nyour code).\n\nAgda is a proof assistant: It is an interactive system for writing\nand checking proofs. Agda is based on intuitionistic type theory, a\nfoundational system for constructive mathematics developed by the\nSwedish logician Per Martin-LÃ¶f. It has many similarities with other\nproof assistants based on dependent types, such as Coq, Epigram and\nNuPRL.";
