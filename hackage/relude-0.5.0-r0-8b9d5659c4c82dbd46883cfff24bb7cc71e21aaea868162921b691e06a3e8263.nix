The types of partial functions lie about their\nbehavior and usage of such functions can lead to the unexpected bugs. Though\nyou can still use some unsafe functions from @Relude.Unsafe@ module, but they\nare not exported by default.\n\n* __Type-safety__. We like to make invalid states unrepresantable. And if it's\npossible to express this concept through the types then we will do it.\n/Example:/ @ whenNotNull :: Applicative f => [a] -> (NonEmpty a -> f ()) -> f () @\n\n* __Performance.__ Prefer @Text@ over @[String](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/29jw0s/whats_wrong_with_string/)@,\nuse spaceleak-free functions (like our custom @sum@ and @product@).\n\n* __Minimalism__ (low number of dependencies). We don't force users of @relude@ to\nstick to some specific lens or text formatting or logging library.\n\n* __Convenience__ (like lifted to @MonadIO@ functions, more reexports). But we\nwant to bring common types and functions (like @containers@ and @bytestrng@)\ninto scope because they are used in almost every application anyways.\n\n* __Provide excellent documentation.__\n\n1. Tutorial\n\n2. Migration guide from @Prelude@\n\n3. Haddock with examples for (almost) every function\n(all examples are tested with [`doctest`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/doctest))\n\n4. Documentation regarding [internal module structure]((http://hackage.haskell.org/package/relude/docs/Relude.html))\n\n5. @relude@-specific [HLint](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hlint) rules: @[.hlint.yaml](https://github.com/kowainik/relude/blob/master/.hlint.yaml)@\n\n* __User-friendliness.__ Ability to quickly migrate to @relude@ if you're familiar\nwith the common libraries like @text@ and @containers@.\n\n* __Exploration.__ Experiment with new ideas and proposals without introducing\nbreaking changes.";
