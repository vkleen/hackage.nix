An example:\n\n@&#123;-&#35; LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings &#35;-&#125;@\n\n> import Control.Applicative\n> import Control.Monad\n> import qualified Data.Text.Lazy as T\n> import Network.HTTP.Types\n> import Web.Welshy\n>\n> fibs :: [Int]\n> fibs = 0 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs)\n>\n> main :: IO ()\n> main = welshy 3000 \$ do\n>     get \"/fibs\" \$ do\n>         offset <- queryParam \"offset\" <|> return 0\n>         length <- queryParam \"length\"\n>\n>         when (offset < 0 || length < 0)\n>              (halt \$ status badRequest400)\n>\n>         when (offset + length > 1000)\n>              (halt \$ status requestedRangeNotSatisfiable416)\n>\n>         let result = take length \$ drop offset fibs\n>         text \$ T.pack \$ show result\n\nSome of the features demonstrated here:\n\n* You can 'halt' the current action at any point and continue\nwith a different one.\n\n* Functions like 'queryParam' and 'jsonParam' have built-in error handling.\n\n* Welshy's 'Action' monad is an instance of 'Alternative'.";
