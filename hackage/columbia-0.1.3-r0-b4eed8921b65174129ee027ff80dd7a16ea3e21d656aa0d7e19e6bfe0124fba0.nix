      description = "Libraries such as binary and cereal support sequential reading and writing but do not rely on any further operations. Many media support seeking in files as well. This library implements a file format that supports random access to data entities by seeking. It is an attempt to improve and extend the applicability of the object graph serialization concept.\n\nThis library enforces a strong concept of immutability in its interface; this has a number of benefits including sharing of substructure. Files in its format have a nominal mutable state that changes over discrete time steps, permitting strong reasoning. See Theory module for a basic equational theory. This work was inspired by Haskell's focus on immutability, and by the programming langauge Clojure's disciplined management of mutable state.\n\nThe database's store has been implemented over memory maps for speed, and is portable between Windows and Linux platforms. This library also uses the syb-with-class library to streamline implementation of serializers for various data entities, so that you don't have to write much boilerplate ;).\n\nRelease notes for version 0.1.1:\n\n* Changed the invariant surrounding how files are seeked for reading/writing procedures. This permits an additional optimization. See Utils module for details.\n\n* Generalized the interface to Utils locking strategies to arbitrary monads incorporating exceptions and I/O.\n\nRelease notes for version 0.1.2:\n\n* Minor bug fixes.\n\nRelease notes for version 0.1.3:\n\n* implemented additional functions specifically for handling dictionaries ('Map's).\n\n* Added basic theory.";
