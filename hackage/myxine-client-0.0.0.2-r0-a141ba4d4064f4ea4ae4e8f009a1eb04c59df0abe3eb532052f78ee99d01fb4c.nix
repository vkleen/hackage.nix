This package defines high-level typed Haskell bindings for using\nMyxine to quickly prototype surprisingly high-performance GUIs.\n\nMyxine itself runs as a local server, separately from these bindings. It is\nbuilt in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started), and can be\ninstalled using the standard Rust build tool @cargo@:\n\n> \$ cargo install myxine\n\nThis Haskell package does __not__ manage the @myxine@ server process; it\nassumes that it is already running in the background (either started by an\nend-user, or managed by your own Haskell application).\n\n__Required extensions:__ This library relies on the @OverloadedRecordFields@\nlanguage extension, since a variety of browser event interfaces share field\nnames/types. Without enabling it, you'll see many bewildering errors about\nambiguous names. You may also find useful for concision the extensions\n@NamedFieldPuns@ and @RecordWildCards@.\n\n__Package versioning and stability:__ This package should be considered in\n\"alpha\" stability at present. No compatibility between alpha versions is\nguaranteed.";
