      description = "@prizm@ is a Haskell library for transforming colors. Specifically,\nproviding functions for transforming between different color spaces\n(@CIE@ and @sRGB@), interpolating colors and adjusting the tint,\nshade, hue, or lightness or a color.\n\nThe inspiration for this library came from a desire to blend two\ncolors represented in the @sRGB@ color space. My research about color\nblending and color space representation in the computer led me to\nthe conclusion that the @CIE L*Ch@ color space is the most effective\nfor blending because it most accurately represents how the human eye\nsees hue and therefore preserves (and blends) hue the most\naccurately.\n\n/Colour Module/\n\nThere is a bit of overlap with the Haskell Colour Module; however,\nthis library is filling a couple of needs the other doesn't\nsatisfy. Primarily transformations and color mutations in the @CIE\nL*Ch@ space.\n\n/Supported Algorithms & Functions/\n\nAll of these functions operate on color within the @CIE L*Ch@ color\nspace. The percentage values may range between -100 and 100.\n\n* @sRGB     <-> CIE XYZ @\n\n* @CIE XYZ  <-> CIE L*ab@\n\n* @CIE L*ab <-> CIE L*Ch@\n\n* Color interpolation\n\n* Tinting / Darkening\n\n* Lightness\n\n* Hue\n\n* Chroma/Saturation\n\n/Formulas, Resources, and Links/\n\n* <http://www.brucelindbloom.com/index.html?Info.html General Color Formulas, Data, and Algorithms>\n\n* <http://rip94550.wordpress.com/2011/07/04/color-cielab-and-tristimulus-xyz/ CIE Conversion Mathematics>\n\n* <http://www.easyrgb.com/index.php?X=MATH&H=01 Conversion Algorithm Sources>\n\n* <https://github.com/mikeemoo/ColorJizz-PHP/blob/master/src/MischiefCollective/ColorJizz/ColorJizz.php Good list of useful color manipulation formulas>";
