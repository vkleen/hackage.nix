As this is tied to the internals\nof the compiler, it only works with specific versions. This version supports,\nGHC 8.6. For older GHC versions see ghc-heap-view-0.5.10.\n\nIt has been inspired by (and taken code from) the vacuum package and the GHCi\ndebugger, but also allows to investigate thunks and other closures.\n\nThis package also provides a new GHCi-command, @:printHeap@, which allows you\nto inspect the current heap representation of a value, including sharing and\ncyclic references. To enable the command, you need to load the included ghci\nscript or add it to @~/.ghci@, as explained by @cabal install@. Once it is\nset up, you can do this:\n\n>> let value = \"A Value\"\n>> let x = (value, if head value == 'A' then value else \"\", cycle [True, False])\n>> :printHeap x\n>let x1 = _bco\n>    x21 = []\n>in (x1,_bco,_bco)\n>> length (take 100 (show x)) `seq` return () -- evaluate everything\n>> :printHeap x\n>let x1 = \"A Value\"\n>    x16 = True : False : x16\n>in (x1,x1,x16)\n\nYou can change the maximum recursion depth using @:setPrintHeapDepth@:\n\n>> :setPrintHeapDepth 3\n>> :printHeap x\n>let x1 = C# 'A' : ... : ...\n>in (x1,x1,True : ... : ...)\n\nIf the view is impaired by blackholes (written @_bh@), running\n@System.Mem.performGC@ usually helps.\n\nThe work on this package has been supported by the Deutsche Telekom Stiftung\n(<http://telekom-stiftung.de>).";
