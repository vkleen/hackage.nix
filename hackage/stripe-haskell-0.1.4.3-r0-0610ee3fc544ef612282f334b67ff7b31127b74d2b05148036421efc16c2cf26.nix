In an attempt to ensure\nAPI consistency and correct parsing of returned JSON, all Stripe versions are hard-coded, and are\ninaccessible to the end-users of this library. When a new Stripe API version is released\nthis library will increment the hard-coded API version.\n\n[Expansion - <https://stripe.com/docs/api#expansion>] Object expansion is supported on Stripe objects eligible for expansion though the `ExpandParams` type.\nObject expansion allows normal Stripe API calls to return expanded objects inside of other objects.\nFor example, a `Customer` object contains a Card ID hash on the default_card field.\nThis default_card hash can be expanded into a full `Card` object inside a `Customer` object.\nAs an example:\n\n> import Web.Stripe\n> import Web.Stripe.Customer\n>\n> main :: IO ()\n> main = do\n>   let config = StripeConfig \"secret key\"\n>   result <- stripe config \$ getCustomerExpandable\n>                                  (CustomerId \"customerid\")\n>                                  ([\"default_card\"] :: ExpandParams)\n>   case result of\n>     Right customer -> print (defaultCard customer) -- Will be an `ExpandedCard`\n>     Left stripeError -> print stripeError\n>\n\n[MetaData - <https://stripe.com/docs/api#metadata>]\nStripe objects allow the embedding of arbitrary metadata.\nAny Stripe object that supports the embedding of metadata is available via this API.\nAs an example:\n\n> import Web.Stripe\n> import Web.Stripe.Coupon\n>\n> main :: IO ()\n> main = do\n>   let config = StripeConfig \"secret key\"\n>   result <- stripe config \$ updateCoupon (CouponId \"couponid\") [(\"key1\", \"value2\"), (\"key2\", \"value2\")]\n>   case result of\n>     Right coupon -> print \$ couponMetaData coupon\n>     Left stripeError -> print stripeError\n\n[Issues - <https://github.com/dmjio/stripe-haskell/issues>]\nAny API recommendations or bugs can be reported on the GitHub issue tracker.\nPull requests welcome!\n";
