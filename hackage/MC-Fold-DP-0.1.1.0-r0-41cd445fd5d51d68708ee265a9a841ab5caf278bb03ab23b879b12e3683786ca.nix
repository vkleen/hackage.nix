Alternatively, the grammar allows\npartition function calculations.\n\nCurrent status:\n\n* comparable prediction accuracy on sequences (compared with MC-Fold)\n\n* possibility to use sparse data correction\n\n* handles non-ACGU nucleotides gracefully\n\n* suboptimals: return all structures within an energy band above the ground state\n\n* constraint folding (fill partial structures)\n\nTodo:\n\n* Boltzmann likelihood calculations\n\n* pseudoknot calculations (currently aiming for a pknotsRG-like algorithm)";
