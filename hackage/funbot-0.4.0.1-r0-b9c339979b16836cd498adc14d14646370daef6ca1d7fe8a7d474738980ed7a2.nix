For experienced Haskell\ndevelopers, this bot can perhaps provide space for creativity and custom\nadvanced plugins and features.\n\nSince this bot is meant for collaborative development while really running\nit, the running instance in @#freepost@ is built from the git repository.\nOccasionally releases will be made to Hackage. If you want to be sure you\nhave all the latest features, check out the git repository (and/or ask us to\nmake a release if you think it's been long enough).";
