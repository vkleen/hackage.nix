It is extensible to any string type, with @String@,\n@ByteString@ and @Text@ provided out of the box.\n\nBasic usage: Parsing a tree (/Tree/), formatting a tree (/Format/).\n\nOther features: Helpers for processing XML trees (/Proc/), trees annotated with\nXML source location (/Annotated/), XML cursors (/Cursor/), more intelligent\nhandling of qualified tag names (/Qualified/), tags qualified with namespaces\n(/Namespaced/), SAX-style parse (/SAX/), and access to the low-level interface\nin case speed is paramount (/IO/).\n\nThe design goals are speed, speed, speed, interface simplicity and modular design.\n\nExamples and benchmarks: <http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Hexpat/>\n\nDARCS repository: <http://code.haskell.org/hexpat/>\n\nCredits to Iavor Diatchki <iavor.diatchki@gmail.com> and the @xml@ (XML.Light)\npackage for /Proc/ and /Cursor/.";
