The merits of using a functional language to describe hardware comes\nfrom the fact that combinational circuits can be directly modeled as\nmathematical functions and that functional languages lend themselves very well\nat describing and (de-)composing mathematical functions.\n\nThis package provides:\n\n* Prelude library containing datatypes and functions for circuit design\n\nTo use the library:\n\n* Import \"CLaSH.Prelude\"\n\n* Additionally import \"CLaSH.Prelude.Explicit\" if you want to design\nexplicitly clocked circuits in a multi-clock setting\n\nA preliminary version of a tutorial can be found in \"CLaSH.Tutorial\", for a\ngeneral overview of the library you should however check out \"CLaSH.Prelude\".";
