Grow is much simpler than those, though, and I might argue way\neasier to use as well.\nOn startup, Grow will look for a file named \"Seed\" in the current\ndirectory, and evaluate the grow expressions contained within.\nFor example, here is a simple Seed file to compile a single C file\ninto an executable.\ntee \$\$arg:in {\nall = (\$main:seq \"All done !\"):in \$execs\nexecs = hook ld [main] [main.o] :in \$objects\nobjects = hook cc [main.o] [main.c]\n}\nNotice the `hook` function ? It is the Grow primitive that calls an\nexternal program to perform actual tasks.\nIn Grow, hooks are expected to only accept files as their arguments,\nso we have to write the wrapper scripts `cc` and `ld` that accept\narguments in the form \"<destination>... <source>...\". They are pretty\ntrivial to write since they only involve renaming variables and\nswapping arguments.\nHere are sample `cc` and `ld` scripts to show you there is nothing\nmagical about them :\n#!/bin/bash\nobj=\"\$1\" ; shift ; src=\"\$1\"\ngcc -c \"\$src\" -o \"\$obj\"\n#!/bin/bash\nbin=\"\$1\" ; shift ; obj=\"\$1\"\ngcc \"\$obj\" -o \"\$bin\"\nIn grow, instead of writing recipes in the configuration, we just declare\nhooks and then write the appropriate wrapper scripts to call compilers with\nthe correct flags and arguments.";
