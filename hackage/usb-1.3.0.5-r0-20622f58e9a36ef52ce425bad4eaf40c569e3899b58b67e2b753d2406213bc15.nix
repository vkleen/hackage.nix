It is implemented as a high-level wrapper around\n@bindings-libusb@\n(<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/bindings-libusb>)\nwhich is a low-level binding to the C library:\n@libusb-1.*@ (<http://libusb.org/>).\n\nThe USB transfer functions in this library have a simple synchronous\ninterface (they block) but are implemented using the @libusb@\nasynchronous interface. They integrate with the GHC event manager\nmaking them efficient (no busy-loops) and interruptible (throwing an\nexception to the thread executing a transfer immediately cancels the\ntransfer).\n\nIf the GHC event manager is not available (because you're either not\nusing GHC or because you're on Windows) the library degrades\ngracefully to the @libusb@ synchronous implementation.\n\nThis documentation assumes knowledge of how to operate USB\ndevices from a software standpoint (descriptors, configurations,\ninterfaces, endpoints, control\\/bulk\\/interrupt\\/isochronous\ntransfers, etc). Full information can be found in the\nUSB 2.0 specification (<http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/>).\n\nFor an example how to use this library see the\n@usb-example@ package (<https://github.com/basvandijk/usb-example>)\nor the @ls-usb@ package (<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/ls-usb>).\n\nBesides this API documentation the following sources might be\ninteresting:\n\n* The @libusb 1.0@ documentation (<http://libusb.sourceforge.net/api-1.0/>).\n\n* The USB 2.0 specification (<http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/>).\n\n* The @bindings-libusb@ documentation (<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/bindings-libusb>).\n\n* \\\"USB in a NutShell\\\" (<http://www.beyondlogic.org/usbnutshell/usb1.htm>).";
