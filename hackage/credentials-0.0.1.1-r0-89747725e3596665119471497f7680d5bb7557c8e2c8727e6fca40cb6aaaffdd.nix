(Currently DynamoDB.)\n\nThe use-case is to avoid storing sensitive information such as passwords and\nconnection strings in plaintext in places such as source control or on\ndevelopers' machines. Instead you can securely administer and distribute\nsecrets, leveraging Amazon's IAM policies for access control and permissions to\nensure limited read-only permissions from production/deployed hosts.\nYou can embed this library into projects such as web applications to securely\nretrieve sensitive information such as database passwords or private keys on startup.\n\nA complementary CLI for management of credentials can be installed via\n<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/credentials-cli credentials-cli>.\n\nYou can read more about other use-cases and prerequisites <https://github.com/brendanhay/credentials here>.";
