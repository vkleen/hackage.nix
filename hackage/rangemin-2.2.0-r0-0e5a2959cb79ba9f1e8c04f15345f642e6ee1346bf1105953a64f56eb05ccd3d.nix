With -fllvm -optlc-O3, this library has been observed to beat\nthe same C++ implementation by 20-30%.\n\nInternally, this library rolls its own stream fusion system, avoiding the @vector@ package's issues with duplicated index\nvariables and providing a few other special features.  This package's API does, however, fuse (to the extent possible) with\ninput vectors using the @vector@ package fusion system.  In particular, it automagically recognizes input vectors whose\nelement types have a natural order-preserving injection into @Int@, converts them, and uses the specialized range-min\nimplementation for @Int@ vectors.
