Shakespeare templates can be used inline with a quasi-quoter or in an external file. Shakespeare interpolates variables according to the type being inserted.\nIn this case, the variable type needs a ToCss instance.\n\nThis package contains 2 css template languages. The Cassius language uses whitespace to avoid the need for closing brackets and semi-colons. Lucius does not care about whitespace and is a strict superset of css. There are also some significant conveniences added for css.\n\nPlease see http://www.yesodweb.com/book/shakespearean-templates for a more thorough description and examples";
