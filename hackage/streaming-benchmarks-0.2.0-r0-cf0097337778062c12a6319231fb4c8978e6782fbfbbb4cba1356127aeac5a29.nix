Use @./run.sh --help@ for all script\noptions.\n\nWith any build tool, run the benchmarks with @--csv=results.csv@ as arguments\n(you can pass any @gauge@ arguments including @--quick@) and then use\n@makecharts results.csv \"streamly,vector,...\" False@ to create the charts.\nThe second argument to @makecharts@ is the list of package names, the third\nargument is whether to plot full or diff from the first package.\n\nSee the README file shipped with the package or\n<https://github.com/composewell/streaming-benchmarks in the github repo>\nfor more details.
