The library was designed for use in UNM's Digital Image Processing class but it can be used for a wide range of image processing purposes.\n\n[Changes]\n\n* Fixed a bug in normalize that was producing images with NaN pixel values\n\n* fixed a bug in shrink that was producing an infinite loop. Resulting in the type signature changing\n\n* Updated the convenience `shrink` function in Boxed.hs to explicitly take a double as it is the pixel type required from the input image.";
