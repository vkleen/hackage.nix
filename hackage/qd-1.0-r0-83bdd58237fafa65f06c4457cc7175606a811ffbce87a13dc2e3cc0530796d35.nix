To compile this package you\nneed libqd to be installed.\n\n@'Numeric.QD.DoubleDouble.DoubleDouble'@ and @'Numeric.QD.QuadDouble.QuadDouble'@\nare strict tuples of @CDouble@s, with instances of:\n@'BinDecode'@, @'DecimalFormat'@, @'Eq'@, @'Floating'@, @'Fractional'@, @'Num'@,\n@'Ord'@, @'Read'@, @'Real'@, @'RealFrac'@, @'Show'@, @'Storable'@, @'Typeable'@.\n\nAdditional note: libqd depends on 64bit doubles, while some FPU architectures\nuse 80bit.  When using the Unsafe modules this might cause erroneous results;\nthe Safe modules (used by the instances above) set and restore the FPU flags\nin foreign code to avoid race conditions from pre-emptive Haskell threading.\n\nThe @'RealFloat'@ instances have been removed in this release as they were\nmostly broken: @'RealFloat'@ semantics are for fixed-precision numbers.";
