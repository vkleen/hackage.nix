The main difference is that these\ntypes-level digits and numerals can be inspected/case-discriminated within\ntype family instances. See the @type-ord@ and @type-cereal@ packages for use\ncases; they ultimately support the @yoko@ package.\nArbitrary type-level digits, for when the radix itself doesn't\nactually matter. It's currently base-128, because that seemed to best\nexpedite the compilation of the modules with which I using this\npackage. Please let me know what you find if you experiment with this.\n'Type.Digits.radix' is the (arbitrary) radix. 'Type.Digits.digit' computes\nthe 'NameG' of a digit from its value (assuming its less than the\nradix). Combinators are provided to compute a full type-level numeral from\nvalues (potentially) larger than the radix.\nThe digits themselves all take less significant numeral as an argument. I\nchose this over minimal digits in promoted lists because I wanted to keep the\nactual encoding of type-level numeral smaller; they get quite large with some\nof my uses and the type family computation becomes quite slow.";
