Yet reading\nand writing to those 'IORef's, 'MVar's and 'TVar's happens still in\ntheir respective monads.\n\n'Data.Global' is designed to meet the following use cases:\n\n* Simplify the declaration of top-level mutable variables, by\navoiding any pragmas as well as 'unsafePerformIO'.\n\n* Avoid having to pass references explicitly throughout the\nprogram in order to let distant parts communicate.\n\n* Enable a communication by convention scheme, where\ne.g. different libraries may communicate without code\ndependencies.\n\n* Simplify the \\\"configuration problem\\\" - at least for code in the\nIO monad.\n\nNote, that this library does not encourage sloppy software design\nby re-introducing all bad effects of global\nvariables. Nevertheless, sometimes global variables are a suitable\nsolution to a problem. In that case \"Data.Global\" simplifies and\nextends their handling significantly.\n\nExamples are in the documentation of \"Data.Global\".\n\nVersion History:\n\n1.0.1.0: added declareEmptyMVar and widened the stm dependency\n\n1.0: First public release";
