The IOB codec\nis used to translate to and fro between the original, forest representation\nof NEs and the sequence of atomic labels. In other words, it provides two\nisomorphic functions for encoding and decoding between both\nrepresentations. Linear-chain conditional random fields, on the other hand,\nprovide the framework for label modelling and tagging.";
