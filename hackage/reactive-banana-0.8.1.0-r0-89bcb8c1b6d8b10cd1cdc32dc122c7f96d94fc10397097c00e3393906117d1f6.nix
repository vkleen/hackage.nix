It promises to avoid the spaghetti code that is all too common in traditional approaches to GUI programming.\n\nSee the project homepage <http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Reactive-banana>\nfor more detailed documentation and examples.\n\n/Stability forecast:/\n\nNo semantic bugs expected.\n\nSignificant API changes are likely in future versions,\nthough the main interface is beginning to stabilize.\n\nThe library features an efficient, push-driven implementation\nand has seen some optimization work.\nHowever, the inner loop still has a rather large constant factor overhead.\nMoreover, there is currently /no/ garbage collection for events that are\ncreated dynamically with @Reactive.Banana.Switch@.";
