The\ncanonical example of this is wanting to use a function such as\n@'finally' :: 'IO' a -> 'IO' a@ to catch exceptions thrown by\na computation @x :: 'ReaderT' MyConfig 'IO' b@.  If @x@ uses\nthe 'ReaderT' function 'ask', it cannot be re-written to run\nin the 'IO' monad, and hence cannot be executed with a\nconstruction like @'lift' (x ``finally`` cleanup)@.\nInstead, you must use the 'wrap' method, provide by module\n\"Control.Monad.Wrap\".  This package contains two further\nmodules:  \"Control.Monad.MultiWrap\" implements 'mwrap', a\nmethod that behaves like 'wrap' but allows wrapping through\nmultiple nested layers of monad transformer.  The module\n\"Control.Monad.MultiLift\" provides 'mlift', a version of\n'lift' that similarly lifts through multiple nested monad\ntransformers.";
