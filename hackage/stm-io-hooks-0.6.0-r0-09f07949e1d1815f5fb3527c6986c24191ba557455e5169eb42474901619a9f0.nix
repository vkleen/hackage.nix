The AdvSTM monad also gives some atomicity\nguarantees for commit-actions:\n\n* When a TVar is modified in a transaction and this transaction commits,\nthe update remains invisible to other threads until the corresponding\nonCommit action is run.\n\n* If the onCommit action throws an exception, the original values of\nthe modified TVars are restored.\n\nNote: The package can be used as a drop-in replacement for\n'Control.Concurrent.STM'. This library was inspired by the AdvSTM monad on\nthe Haskell Wiki (see <http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/?title=New_monads/MonadAdvSTM>).\n\nFeedback is welcome!";
