The way this is achieved is through versioning and defined migration functions to migrate older (or newer) versions to the one used.\n\nThe library mainly consists of two classes:\n\n* @SafeJSON a@: Defines the version of @a@ and if (and how) it is migratable.\n\n* @Migrate a@: Defines the data type (@MigrateFrom a@) that can be migrated to @a@ and how to migrate from that type.\n\nUsing these two classes, JSON serialized data types will stay parsable, even after format changes.\n\nFor a more in-depth explanation and examples, please see the README at <https://github.com/Vlix/safe-json#readme>";
