      description = "@logging@ is a wrapper around @monad-logger@ and @fast-logger@ which makes\nit easy to log from any 'MonadLogger' environment, or from 'IO'.  It\nprovides the following conveniences on top of those libraries:\n\n- A 'MonadLogger' instance for 'IO'.  Usually this is bad for libraries, but\ncan be very convenience for application writers who know they always want\nto log from IO to the console.  If you need to log to other sources, or to\nmake logging compile-time optional, use @monad-logger@ directly.\n\n- A set of shorter functions to type: 'debug', 'log', 'warn', plus others\nthat flush after each message, or which allow providing a message source\nstring.\n\n- Logging variants of 'error', 'trace' and 'traceShow', called 'errorL',\n'traceL' and 'traceShowL'.  These use 'unsafePerformIO' in order to act as\ndirect replacements, so the usual caveats apply.\n\n- A global function, 'setDebugLevel', which uses a global 'IORef' to record\nthe logging level, saving you from having to carry around the notion of\n\"verbosity level\" in a Reader environment.\n\n- A set of \"timed\" variants, 'timedLog' and 'timedDebug', which report how\nlong the specified action took to execute in wall-clock time.";
