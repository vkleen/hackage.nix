It has become a standard technique for\nnonlinear least-squares problems and can be thought of\nas a combination of steepest descent and the\nGauss-Newton method. When the current solution is far\nfrom the correct one, the algorithm behaves like a\nsteepest descent method: slow, but guaranteed to\nconverge. When the current solution is close to the\ncorrect solution, it becomes a Gauss-Newton method.\n\nBoth unconstrained and constrained (under linear\nequations and box constraints) Levenberg-Marquardt\nvariants are included.  All functions have Double and\nFloat variants.\n\nNote that the included\n<http://www.ics.forth.gr/~lourakis/levmar/ C library>\nis lightly patched to make it pure. This way the\nfunctions can be used inside @unsafePerformIO@.\n\nA note regarding the license:\n\nAll files EXCEPT those in the levmar-2.4 directory fall\nunder the BSD3 license. The levmar C library, which is\nbundled with this binding, falls under the GPL. If you\nbuild a program which is linked with this binding then\nit is also linked with levmar. This means such a\nprogram can only by distributed under the terms of the\nGPL.";
