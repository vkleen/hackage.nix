      description = "@proxied@ is a simple library that exports a function to\nconvert constant functions to ones that take a @proxy@\nvalue. This is useful for retrofiting typeclasses that\nhave functions that return a constant value for any value\nof a particular type (but still need to consume some\nvalue, since one of the parameterized types must appear\nin a typeclass function). Often, these functions are\ngiven @undefined@ as an argument, which might be\nconsidered poor design.\n\n@Proxy@, however, does not carry any of the\nerror-throwing risks of @undefined@, so it is much more\npreferable to take @Proxy@ as an argument to a constant\nfunction instead of @undefined@. Unfortunately, @Proxy@\nwas included in @base@ until GHC 7.8, so many of @base@'s\ntypeclasses still contain constant functions that aren't\namenable to passing @Proxy@. @proxied@ addresses this\nissue by providing variants of those typeclass functions\nthat take an explicit @proxy@ value.";
