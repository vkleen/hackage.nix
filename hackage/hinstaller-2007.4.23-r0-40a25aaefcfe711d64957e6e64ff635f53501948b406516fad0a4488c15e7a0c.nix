Thus this can be considered in the same model as Java .jar\nfiles or executable zip or other file archives.\n\nNote that the current implementation is now reasonably efficient. However,\neither use -fvia-C which will take care of all compilation for you (but\nwill be slow) or use -fasm which will probably fail at the linking stage.\nCompile the generated .c files and manually link together to complete the\ninstallation. On any non-trivial sized file, you may need to increase GHC's\nstack with +RTS -K32M -RTS to avoid stack overflows.";
