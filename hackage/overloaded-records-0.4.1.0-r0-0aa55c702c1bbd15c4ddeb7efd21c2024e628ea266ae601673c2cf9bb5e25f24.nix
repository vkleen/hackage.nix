Most importantly, this library provides\nTemplate Haskell functions for automatic deriving of instancess for\n@HasField@ and @ModifyField@ type classes. With these instances overloaded\nfields can be used directly as getters and lenses.\n\nSee README for usage examples.\n\nThis implementation is highly experimental and may change rapidly.\n\nMore about the current status of OverloadedRecordFields language extension\ncan be found on:\n<https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/Records/OverloadedRecordFields GHC Wiki: OverloadedRecordFields>.";
