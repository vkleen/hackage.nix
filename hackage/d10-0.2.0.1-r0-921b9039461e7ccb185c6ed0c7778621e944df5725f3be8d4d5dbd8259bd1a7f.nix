With the @QuasiQuotes@ GHC extension enabled, a single\ndigit like /7/ can be written as @[d10|7|]@, and a list of digits\nlike /[4,5,6]/ can be written as @[d10|456|]@. For \"Data.D10.Char\"\nand \"Data.D10.Num\", the quasi-quoters are an important feature,\nbecause the @D10@ types defined in these modules have unsafe\nconstructors, and the quasi-quoters provide compile-time assurance\nthat we never construct a @D10@ that represents a value outside\nthe range /0/ to /9/. For \"Data.D10.Safe\", the quasi-quoter is\noffered merely as a possible convenience, allowing you to write\n@[d10|456789|]@ in place of the somewhat longer expression\n@[D4,D5,D6,D7,D8,D9]@.";
