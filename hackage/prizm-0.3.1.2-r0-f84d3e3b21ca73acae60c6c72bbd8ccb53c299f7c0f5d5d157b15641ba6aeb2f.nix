Specifically\nproviding functions for transforming between different color spaces,\ninterpolating colors and adjusting the tint, shade, hue, or\nlightness or a color.\n\nMy inspiration for writing this was Sass and Bourbon, both implement\ninteresting functions for computing with colors for use in\nstylesheets and I wanted the same thing for use in <http://fvisser.nl/clay/ Clay>.\n\n/Colour Module/\n\nThere is some overlap with the Haskell Colour Module that already\nexists; however, this library is filling a couple of needs the\nother doesn't satisfy. Primarily transformations and color\nmutations in the CIE L*Ch space.\n\n/Supported Algorithms & Functions/\n\nAll of these functions operate on color within the CIE L\\*Ch\nrepresentation. The percentage values may range between -100\nand 100.\n\n* sRGB <-> CIE XYZ\n\n* CIE XYZ <-> CIE L\\*ab\n\n* CIE L\\*ab <-> CIE L\\*Ch\n\n* Color interpolation\n\n* Tinting / Darkening\n\n* Lightness\n\n* Hue\n\n* Chroma/Saturation\n\n/Formulas, Resources, and Links/\n\n* <http://www.brucelindbloom.com/index.html?Info.html General Color Formulas, Data, and Algorithms>\n\n* <http://rip94550.wordpress.com/2011/07/04/color-cielab-and-tristimulus-xyz/ CIE Conversion Mathematics>\n\n* <http://www.easyrgb.com/index.php?X=MATH&H=01 Conversion Algorithm Sources>\n\n* <https://github.com/mikeemoo/ColorJizz-PHP/blob/master/src/MischiefCollective/ColorJizz/ColorJizz.php Good list of useful color manipulation formulas>";
