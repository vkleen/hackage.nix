Compare the original code from `iconv`:\n\n> module Main where\n>\n> import Codec.Text.IConv\n>\n> main :: IO ()\n> main = print \$ convert \"UTF-8\" \"LATIN1\" \"hello\"\n\nWith the equivalent in `iconv-typed`:\n\n> module Main where\n>\n> import Codec.Text.IConv.Typed\n>\n> main :: IO ()\n> main = print \$ convert @\"UTF-8\" @\"LATIN1\" \"hello\"\n\nAs a result, this code will compile and run only if the passed encoding resolves to a supported\nencoding (as retrieved at compile time by calling \"iconv -l\"). For example, the following won't compile:\n\n> main = print \$ convert @\"UFT-8\" \"LATIN1\" \"hello\"\n\nAs `UFT` is mispelled.\n\nUsing GHC < 8.0 that doesn't supports `TypeInType`? No problem, we've got you covered!\n\n> module Main where\n>\n> import Codec.Text.IConv.Typed\n>\n> main :: IO ()\n> main = print \$ convert (E :: E \"UTF-8\") (E :: E \"LATIN1\") \"hello\"";
