It attempts to be very easy to\ninstall and use while being \\\"good enough\\\" for many applications\n(simulations, games, etc.). The API builds upon and is largely\nanalogous to that of the Haskell 98 @Random@ module (more\nrecently @System.Random@).\n\nPure:\n\n> (sample,g) = normal  myRandomGen  -- using a Random.RandomGen\n> samples    = normals myRandomGen  -- infinite list\n> samples2   = mkNormals 10831452   -- infinite list using a seed\n\nIn the IO monad:\n\n> sample    <- normalIO\n> samples   <- normalsIO  -- infinite list\n\nWith custom mean and standard deviation:\n\n> (sample,g) = normal'    (mean,sigma) myRandomGen\n> samples    = normals'   (mean,sigma) myRandomGen\n> samples2   = mkNormals' (mean,sigma) 10831452\n\n> sample    <- normalIO'  (mean,sigma)\n> samples   <- normalsIO' (mean,sigma)\n\nInternally the library uses the Central Limit Theorem to\napproximate normally distributed values from multiple uniformly\ndistributed random values.";
