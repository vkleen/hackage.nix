The biggest is the\nuse of MonadControlBase for exceptions.\n\nVersion 0.5.0.1: This preliminary release is a preview to gauge community\ninterest.  Not even all major features are implemented; things that exist\nonly as stubs include encryption, compression, chunking, and reading back\ncookies.  Nonetheless it may be useful if run behind a reverse proxy that\nprovides the missing features transparently, such as Apache.";
