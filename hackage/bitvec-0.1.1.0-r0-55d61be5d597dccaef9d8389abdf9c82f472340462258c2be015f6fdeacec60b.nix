This one packs 8 bits per byte, as expected\n(`UArray` from the `array` package also uses one bit per `Bool`).\n\nIn addition to the `Vector` interface, there are several high-level\noperations and some low-level ones suitable for building new bulk\noperations by viewing the bit-vector as a word vector.";
