It provides for fast generation\nof very high quality pseudorandom numbers. The source for the C code\ncan be found here:\n\n<http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/emt64.html>\n\nThis library provides a purely functional binding to the 64 bit\nclassic mersenne twister, along with instances of RandomGen, so the\ngenerator can be used with System.Random. The generator should\ntypically be a few times faster than the default StdGen (but a tad\nslower than the impure 'mersenne-random' library based on SIMD\ninstructions and destructive state updates.\n";
