It's\nnot the fanciest, it doesn't have a cargo-van full of features.  This\nlogger is designed to be straightforward to use, provide a good set of\nstandard features, and be useable across a broad set of code.\n\n* Logging is a monadic activity.  This activity is most often\nperformed in a monad stack with a MonadIO context to allow\nwriting to files.\n\n* The specific logging action implementaions are managed separately\nfrom the actions of logging messages in the target code.  This\nallows logging to be configurable and the manner of logging to\nbe specified at startup time without requiring changes in the\ncode from which log messages are being generated.\n\n* The logging implementation code can use cofunctors to adjust\nexisting logging.\n\n* Main code will typically retrieve the logging actions from a\nReader context in your monad stack.\n\n* The prettyprinter package is used for formatting.";
