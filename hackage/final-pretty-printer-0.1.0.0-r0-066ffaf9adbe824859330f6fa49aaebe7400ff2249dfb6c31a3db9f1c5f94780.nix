This means it can be\nextended by monad transformers.\nSemantic annotations allow pretty printer\ndocuments to contain references to the data that\nthey represent, which can enable interactive output.\nProportional-width fonts are supported by\nallowing the measurement of widths to be\nperformed in some arbitrary monad, so IO can be\nused to look at the output of a font rendering library.";
