The service supports homogeneous migrations such as Oracle to\nOracle, as well as heterogeneous migrations between different database\nplatforms, such as Oracle to MySQL or SQL Server to PostgreSQL.\n\nThe types from this library are intended to be used with\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka amazonka>, which provides\nmechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.\n\nUse of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.\nThis is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding\nde/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.\nThe provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries\nsuch as <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens lens> or\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core lens-family-core>.\n\nSee \"Network.AWS.DMS\" or <https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/ the AWS Documentation>\nto get started.";
