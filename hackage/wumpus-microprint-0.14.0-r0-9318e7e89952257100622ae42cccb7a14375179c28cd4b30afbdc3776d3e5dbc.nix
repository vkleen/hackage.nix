To do the\nsubject justice, more effort has to be spent on tokenizing\n(which does not contribute to advancing Wumpus) than drawing.\nEventually I intend to polish this library, but I do not expect\nto do this soon.\n\n\\[1\\] <http://scg.unibe.ch/archive/papers/Robb05b-microprintsESUG.pdf>\n\nChangelog:\n\nv0.13.0 to v0.14.0:\n\n* Updated to track changes to Wumpus-Basic and Wumpus-Drawing.\n\n* Removed the shim module @Wumpus.Microprint@ this was\nprioritizing the Teletype drawing style, however this style\nis now out-of-date and it may be dropped in future revisions\nrather than revised.\n\nv0.12.0 to v0.13.0:\n\n* Updated to track changes to Wumpus-Basic and Wumpus-Core.\n";
