We expect this program to fill\na serious gap in current descriptions of Haskell, both as a starting point\nfor discussions about existing features of the type system, and as a platform\nfrom which to explore new proposals.\n\nThis package is derived from the Haskell '98 + Multiparameter Type Classes package of THIH.";
