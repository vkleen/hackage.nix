Nlopt by default does not include shared libraries,\nwhich seems to be needed to run things from ghci (ie. you need to\n@./configure --enable-shared@ when building nlopt).\n\nA embedded language, similar to the one provided by glpk-hs, is\ndefined in \"Ipopt.NLP\". The goal is to define problems at a level\nsimilar to other \"algebraic modeling languages\", but retain some\nof the safety and flexibility available in haskell. There is some\noverhead <http://code.haskell.org/~aavogt/ipopt-hs/examples/bench.html>\nbut perhaps it is negligible for your uses.\n\nCurrent limitations include:\n\n* copying in every iteration happens between between\n\"Data.Vector.Storable\" and \"Data.Vector\" might be avoidable\nsomehow.  Currently it is done because AD needs a Traversable\nstructure, but Storable vectors are not traversable. Note that\nthere is a \"Numeric.AD.Mode.Forward.Double\" but as yet none\nfor Vectors of Double\n\n* sparseness of derivatives isn't used\n\n* no binding to sensitivity parts as-implemented in ipopt";
