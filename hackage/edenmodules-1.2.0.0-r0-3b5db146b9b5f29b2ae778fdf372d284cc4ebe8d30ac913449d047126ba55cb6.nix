Eden extends Haskell with a small set of syntactic constructs\nfor explicit process specification and creation. While providing enough\ncontrol to implement parallel algorithms efficiently, it frees the\nprogrammer from the tedious task of managing low-level details by\nintroducing automatic communication (via head-strict lazy lists),\nsynchronisation, and process handling.\nThe Eden-modules depend on GHC, and should normally use a GHC extension\nto support parallel execution using message passing.\nThis modified GHC-Eden compiler is available from\n<http://www.mathematik.uni-marburg.de/~eden>.\nWhen built using a standard GHC, this package will produce a\nthreaded simulation of Eden.\nThe Eden homepage     <http://www.mathematik.uni-marburg.de/~eden>\nprovides more documentation and a tutorial.";
