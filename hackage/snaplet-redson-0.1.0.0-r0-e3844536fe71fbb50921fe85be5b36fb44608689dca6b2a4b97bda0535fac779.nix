CRUD methods\nare mapped to HTTP `POST`, `GET`, `PUT` and\n`DELETE`. Valid objects are described using model\ndefinition syntax, which includes information on\nfields and permissions. The snaplet supports\nrole-based user permissions system as implemented\nby Snap authentication. Model definitions may\nalso be used by browser JavaScript to provide\ninterface to create or edit objects.\nThere is a permission-less transparent mode,\nWebSocket create/delete notifications and\ntimeline method to serve information about\nrecently added objects. Ad-hoc search is\nimplemented in Redis and provided via snaplet\nroute.\nThere's a \"snapless\" part of the package, which\nimplements Snap-agnostic Redis CRUD operations\nfor key-value pair collections and may be used\nfor tools which operate with storage directly\nwithout using web framework.\nMore of usage documentation is contained in\n<https://github.com/dzhus/snaplet-redson/blob/master/README.org>";
