It is NOT an SQL database.  It is not free for commercial use.\n\nThe binding is only about 70% complete, but it should allow you to write a fairly\nserious application.  If you would like a particular part of the API added,\nplease contact me.\n\nIf Berkeley DB or DB XML is not installed in the default location of /usr or\n/usr/local, you will need to specify the paths in this way:\n\n> cabal install BerkeleyDBXML \\\n>    --extra-include-dirs=/usr/local/dbxml-2.5.16/include/ \\\n>    --extra-include-dirs=/usr/local/dbxml-2.5.16/include/dbxml/ \\\n>    --extra-lib-dirs=/usr/local/dbxml-2.5.16/lib/\n\nSee the examples/ directory for examples.\n\nBerkeley DB XML home page:\n<http://www.oracle.com/database/berkeley-db/xml/index.html>\n\nHaskell binding tutorial:\n<http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/BerkeleyDBXML>\n\nDARCS repository:\n<http://code.haskell.org/BerkeleyDBXML/>\n\nChanges: 0.7: Compatible (only) with dbxml 2.5.";
