It's output is a\nnetwork of nodes laid out in two dimensions where each node has a weight\nvector associated with it. This weight vector has the same dimension as the\ninput vectors and is meant to be intepreted as a cluster center, i.e. it\nrepresents those input vectors whose distance to the node's weight vector\nis minimal when compared to the distance to the other nodes weight vectors.\nSee <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSOM> for an explanation of the algorithm.\nThe algorithm was introduced in:\nAlahakoon, D., Halgamuge, S. K. and Sirinivasan, B.
