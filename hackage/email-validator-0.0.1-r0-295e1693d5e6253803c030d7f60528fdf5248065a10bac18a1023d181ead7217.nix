This is not required; in fact many domains accept mail\nvia an @A@ record for e.g. example.com which is used in lieu of an @MX@\nrecord. This behavior can be controlled via the @--accept-a@ flag.\n\nThese checks are performed in parallel using the number of available\nthreads. To increase the number of threads, you can pass the\nappropriate flag to the GHC runtime.\n\nThis will set the number of threads to 25:\n\n@\n\$ email-validator -i addresses.csv +RTS -N25\n@\n\n/Input/\n\nThe @input@ file (default: stdin) should be a list of email addresses,\none per line.
