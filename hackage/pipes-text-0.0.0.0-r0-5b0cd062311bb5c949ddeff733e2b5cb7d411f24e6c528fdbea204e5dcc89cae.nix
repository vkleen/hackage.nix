Folds like `length` and grouping\noperations like `lines` simply  adjust for the differences between\n`ByteString` and `Text` and `Word8` and `Char`. The distinctive feature\nof the library is the `Text/ByteString` encoding and decoding apparatus.\n\nTo this core are added some simple functions akin to the `String`\noperations in `Pipes.Prelude`, and others like the utilities in `Data.Text`.\n\nAll of the `IO` operations defined here - e.g `readFile`, `stdout` etc.\n- are conveniences akin to those in `Data.Text.IO` which e.g. try to\nfind the system encoding and use the exceptions defined in the `text`\nlibrary. Proper `IO` in the sense of this library will employ\n`pipes-bytestring` in conjuntion with 'pure' operations like\n`decodeUtf8` and `encodeUtf8` that are defined here.";
