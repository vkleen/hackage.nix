Any further restrictions\nare listed in the modules that need them.\n\nWe use the @vector@ package to represent vectors and\nmatrices, although it would be possible to use something like\n@hmatrix@ easily.\n\nCurrently only CG_DESCENT method is implemented.\n\nIf you want to use automatic differentiation to avoid hand-writing gradient functions,\nyou can use\n<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/nonlinear-optimization-ad nonlinear-optimization-ad> package or\n<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/nonlinear-optimization-backprop nonlinear-optimization-backprop> package.";
