In\n<https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv Ruby>,\n<https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv Python> and\n<https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv Javascript> there are libraries\nto facilitate loading of configuration options from configuration\nfiles. This library loads configuration to environment variables for\nprograms written in Haskell.\n\nTo use, call `loadFile` from your application:\n\n> import Configuration.Dotenv\n> loadFile False \"/my/dotenvfile\"\n\nThis package also includes an executable that can be used\nto inspect the results of applying one or more Dotenv files\nto the environment, or for invoking your executables with\nan environment after one or more Dotenv files is applied.\n\nSee the <https://github.com/stackbuilders/dotenv-hs Github>\npage for more information on this package.";
