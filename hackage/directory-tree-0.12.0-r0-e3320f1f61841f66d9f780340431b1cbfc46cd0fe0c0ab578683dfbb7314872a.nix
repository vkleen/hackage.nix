Then check for any IO failures:\n\n> do (base :/ d2) <- readDirectory \"../parent_dir/dir2/\"\n>    let failed = anyFailed d2\n>    if failed then ...\n\nUse Foldable instance function to concat a directory 'dir' of text files into a\nsingle file under the same directory:\n\n> do (b :/ dt) <- readDirectory dir\n>    let f = F.concat dt\n>    return\$ b :/ File \"ALL_TEXT\" f\n\nOpen all the files in the current directory as lazy bytestrings, ignoring\nthe base path in Anchored wrapper:\n\n> import qualified Data.ByteString.Lazy as B\n> do (_ :/ dTree) <- readDirectoryWith B.readFile \"./\"\n\nThis version also offers an experimental function `readDirectoryWithL` that does\nlazy directory IO, allowing you to treat the returned `DirTree` as if it were a\nnormal lazily-generated data structure.\n\nFor example, the following does only the amount of IO necessary to list the file\nnames of the children of the root directory, similar to \"ls /\":\n\n> do d <- readDirectoryWithL readFile \"/\"\n>    mapM_ (putStrLn . name) \$ contents \$ free d\n\nAny ideas or suggestions for improvements are most welcome :-)\n\n/CHANGES/: from 0.11\n\n- export 'System.Directory.Tree.transformDir' as requested\n\n- add test suite to cabal file\n\n- remove redundant @removeNonexistent@ (thanks to dmwit for patch)\n";
