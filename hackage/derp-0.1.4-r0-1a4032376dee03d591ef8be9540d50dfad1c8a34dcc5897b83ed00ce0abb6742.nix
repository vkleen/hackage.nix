Our paper on Arxiv details the theory of\nparsing with derivatives: <http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.5023>.\nThis implementation uses my latest work on the theory that\nbrings the O(n*|G|^2) complexity bound to O(n) for parsing\nmost not-painfully-ambiguous grammars.  (|G| would be the\nsize of the initial grammar, n would be size of the input.\nThese bounds are based off of observation and intuition;\nthey are not proven yet.)  This implementation will not\nterminate if the resulting parse forest is infinite.  We\nknow how to extend the implementation to work for infinite\nparse forests with little effort.
