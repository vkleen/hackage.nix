      description = "@loops@ is a library for fast, imperative-style loops with a clean syntax.\n\nFeatures\n\n* Fast, imperative-style loops with a clean syntax. Bind (`>>=`) nests loops,\nso in `do`-notation, each subsequent line is nested inside loops that appear\nabove it.\n\n* Iteration over common data structures, like lists and vectors.\n\n* Robust performance because there is no reliance on fusion.\n\n* NEW! Loop-unrolling to arbitrary depth. Unrollable loop combinators are\nprovided in `Control.Monad.Loop.Unroll`. (The simple, \"rolled\" interface is\nstill provided in `Control.Monad.Loop`.) The unrolling depth set at the call\nsite at compile time. My benchmarks show that folding over unrolled loops is\nup to 25% faster than folding over unboxed vectors!\n\nFor best performance, please compile your code with @-O2@. You should also\nuse GHC's LLVM backend if possible; it generally produces faster executables.";
