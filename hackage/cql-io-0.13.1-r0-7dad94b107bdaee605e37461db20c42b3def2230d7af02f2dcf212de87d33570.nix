The feature-set includes:\n\n* /Node discovery/. The driver discovers nodes automatically from a small\nset of bootstrap nodes.\n\n* /Customisable load-balancing policies/. In addition to pre-built LB\npolicies such as round-robin, users of this library can provide their\nown policies if desired.\n\n* /Support for connection streams/. Requests can be multiplexed over a\nfew connections.\n\n* /Customisable retry settings/. Support for default retry settings as well\nas local overrides per query.";
