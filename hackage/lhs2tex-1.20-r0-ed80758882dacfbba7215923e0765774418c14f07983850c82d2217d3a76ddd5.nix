It is not fully automatic in\nthe sense that it will turn an arbitrary literate Haskell document into\na LaTeX document without further work.\n\nNearly all aspects about the output and formatting are configurable.\nOutput of code can be made using proportional fonts in such a way that\neven complex horizontal alignment is preserved. The preprocessor can also\nbe invoked in another mode to just extract the Haskell code.";
