HUnit-Plus provides functions and operators\nfor creating assertions and tests similar to those provided by the\nHUnit framework.  Unlike HUnit, HUnit-Plus uses the same data\nstructures as cabal's \"Distribution.TestSuite\" framework, allowing\nfull compatibility with cabal's testing facilities.\n\nHUnit-Plus also provides expanded reporting capabilities, including\nthe ability to generate JUnit-style XML reports, along with a very\nflexible mechanism for selecting which tests to be executed.\nLastly, HUnit-Plus provides a wrapper which generates standalone\ntest-execution programs from a set of test suites.";
