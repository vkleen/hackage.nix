The core package\ncontains all the functionality of n-ary sums and products, whereas this\npackage provides the datatype-generic programming support on top.\n\nExamples of using this library are provided by the following\npackages:\n\n* @<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/basic-sop basic-sop>@ basic examples,\n\n* @<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pretty-sop pretty-sop>@ generic pretty printing,\n\n* @<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-sop lens-sop>@ generically computed lenses,\n\n* @<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/json-sop json-sop>@ generic JSON conversions.\n\nA detailed description of the ideas behind this library is provided by\nthe paper:\n\n* Edsko de Vries and Andres Löh.\n<http://www.andres-loeh.de/TrueSumsOfProducts True Sums of Products>.\nWorkshop on Generic Programming (WGP) 2014.\n";
