The library may be of\nlimited usefulness outside of x86 architectures where the fetch-and-add\ninstruction is not available.\n\nHere is an example benchmark measuring the time taken to concurrently write\nand read 100,000 messages, with work divided amongst increasing number of\nreaders and writers, comparing against the top-performing queues in the\nstandard libraries. Scale is milliseconds.\n\n<<http://i.imgur.com/safKkCP.png>>\n\nAnd here is a view on just the unagi implementations.\n\n<<http://i.imgur.com/K6s2pXj.png>>\n";
