For example,\n\n> \$ curl -d '' http://localhost:8900\n> pg-harness-test:pg-harness-pass@db:5432/temp_ba36rk6rqvs92wbofk55sz5k3pcl0u74x\n\nThe response indicates that the temporary database \"@temp_ba36rk6rqvs92wbofk55sz5k3pcl0u74x@\"\nhas been created on the database server \"@db@\" (port 5432) and made available\nto the user \"@pg-harness-test@\" using the password \"@pg-harness-pass@\".\n\nThe database will automatically be destroyed after a configurable duration,\nthough any temporary databases that have not been destroyed when the service\nis stopped will stay around.\n\n__NOTE__: No attempt has been made to prevent DoS attacks, so you should __NOT__\nrun this on any network facing the public Internet.
