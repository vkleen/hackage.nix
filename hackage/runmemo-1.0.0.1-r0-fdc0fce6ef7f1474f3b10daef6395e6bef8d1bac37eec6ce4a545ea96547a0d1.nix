For this example,\nwe need a Memoizer that can handle an @Integer@ input,\nand an @Integer@ output. @Data.MemoCombinators@ provides\n@integral@, which handles any @Integral@ input, and\nany output. @Data.MemoUgly@ provides @memo@,\nwhich can memoize any function @a -> b@, given an @Ord@ instance\nfor @a@.\n\nThird, let's run our memoizers!\nSince we have decoupled the definition of the memoized function\nfrom its actual memoization, we can create multiple\nmemoized versions of the same function if we so desire.\n\n@\nimport qualified Data.MemoUgly as Ugly\nimport qualified Data.MemoCombinators as MC\n\nfibUgly :: Integer -> Integer\nfibUgly = runMemo Ugly.memo fib\n\nfibMC :: Integer -> Integer\nfibMC = runMemo MC.integral fib\n@\n\nYou could easily do the same with @Data.MemoTrie.memo@,\n@Data.Function.Memoize.memoize@, etc.\n\nUsing this technique, you can create local memoized functions\nwhose memo tables are garbage collected as soon as\nthey are no longer needed.";
