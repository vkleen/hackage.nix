Any errors in these\nbindings are my responsibility not that of the GTS team.\n\nNOTE: Not all functionality is covered by these bindings at this\ntime, but there should be enough to be useful.\n\nNOTE: Documentation does not build on Hackage DB (due to Hackage\nbuild hosts not having GTS on them) but can be built with\n/cabal haddock/\n\nNOTE: Some warnings are produced during compilation; these appear\nto be the result of the Bindings-GTS macros and may safely be\nignored (I hope!)\n\nChangelog:\n\n* 0.0.1 Initial version.\n\n* 0.0.2 Improved documentation; added some missing functions; fixed a function name; bumped version of base to >=4\n\n* 0.0.3 Adding missing GTS enumeration for CSG boolean operations; added some more missing functions; fixed some bad FunPtr references;\nadded some helper methods\n";
