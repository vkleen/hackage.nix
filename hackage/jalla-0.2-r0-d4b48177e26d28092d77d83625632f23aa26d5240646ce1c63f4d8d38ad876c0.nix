You can find its documentation at\n<http://www.goschs.de/jalla>.\n\nJalla aims at providing high level functions for linear algebra computations which\nshould be fast and easy enough to use. Under the hood, BLAS and LAPACKE are used\n(LAPACKE is a standard C interface to LAPACK which is part of LAPACK since version 3.4).\n\nThe modules Numeric.Jalla.Matrix and Numeric.Jalla.Vector are probably\nthe most useful ones for users. Everything under Numeric.Jalla.Foreign\nis basically wrapping stuff.\n\nCurrently, I am adding new functions whenever I find some time. Please help, if you want to!\nThere are not many tests yet, and we need some nicer error reporting (nicer than exceptions).";
