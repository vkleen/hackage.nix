      description = "A Web framework with some unique features thanks to the power of the Haskell language.\nMFlow run stateful server processes; All the flow of request and responses are coded by the programmer in a single function.\nAllthoug single request-response flows and callbacks are possible. Therefore, the code is\nmore understandable.f\n\nThese processes are stopped and restarted by the\napplication server on demand, including its execution state. Therefore session management\nis automatic. State consistence and transactions are given by the TCache package.\n\nThe processes interact trough widgets, that are an extension of formlets with\nadditional combinators, formatting, link management, callbacks, modifiers, caching,\nbyteString conversion and AJAX. All is coded in pure haskell.\n\nThe interfaces and communications are abstract, but there are bindings for HSP, Text.XHtml and byteString\n, Hack and WAI but it can be extended to non Web based architectures.\n\nThis release add transparent back button management, cached widgets, callbacks, modifiers, heterogeneous formatting, AJAX,\nand WAI integration.\n\nIt is designed for applications that can be run with no deployment with runghc in order\nto speed up the development process.\n\nSee \"MFlow.Forms\" for details\n\nAltroug still it is experimental, it is being used in at least one future commercial project. So I have te commitment to\ncontinue its development. There are many examples in the documentation and in the package.\n\nDue to compilation problems in Hackage, this release has the bindings for Hack and HSP not exposed,\nbut they can be found in the source files.\n\nTo do:\n\n-Clustering\n";
