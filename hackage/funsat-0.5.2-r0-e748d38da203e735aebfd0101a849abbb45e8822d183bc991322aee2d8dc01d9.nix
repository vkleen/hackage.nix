Current features include two-watched literals,\nconflict-directed learning, non-chronological backtracking, a VSIDS-like\ndynamic variable ordering, and restarts.  Our goal is to facilitate\nconvenient embedding of a reasonably fast SAT solver as a constraint\nsolving backend in other applications.\nCurrently along this theme we provide /unsatisfiable core/ generation,\ngiving (hopefully) small unsatisfiable sub-problems of unsatisfiable input\nproblems (see \"Funsat.Resolution\").";
