By default, ip6addrcan outputs only validated inputs, i.e. IPv6 addresses, removing CIDR suffix if necessary. Already compressed IPv6 adresses are recomputed. -e option throws out discarded inputs to stderr (which have of course to be redirected). The second command-line tool, ip6addrgen, generates random IPv6 adresses. -p option allows to provide a prefix to all IPv6 adresses to generate. -n option allows to provide the amount of IPv6 addresses to generate. Outputted IPv6 addresses have to be pipelined through ip6addrcan to be canonized.";
