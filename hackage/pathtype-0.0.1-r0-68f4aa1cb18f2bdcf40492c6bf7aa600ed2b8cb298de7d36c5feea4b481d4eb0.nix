The idea is that there are\ntwo phantom type parameters - the first should be 'Abs' or 'Rel',\nand the second 'File' or 'Dir'. A number of type synonyms are\nprovided for common types:\n\n> type AbsFile    = Path Abs File\n> type RelFile    = Path Rel File\n> type AbsDir     = Path Abs Dir\n> type RelDir     = Path Rel Dir\n> type RelPath fd = Path Rel fd\n> type DirPath ar = Path ar Dir\n\nThe type of the 'combine' (aka '</>') function gives the idea:\n\n> (</>) :: DirPath ar -> RelPath fd -> Path ar fd\n\nTogether this enables us to give more meaningful types to\na lot of the functions, and (hopefully) catch a bunch more\nerrors at compile time.\n\nThe basic API (and properties satisfied) are heavily influenced\nby Neil Mitchell's 'System.FilePath' module.\n\nWARNING -- THE API IS NOT YET STABLE -- WARNING";
