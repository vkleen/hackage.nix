If you like to manage your music collection using\nthe command line, this program can be used to approximate \\\"shuffle\\\".\n\nMore precisely, it starts at the current directory, picks a random entry,\nand descends if it is a directory.  It does not give more weight to\ndirectories containing more files.  It should only fail if there are no\nregular files under the current directory that you can see.\n\nIf you are wondering why I bothered to use crypto-grade random number\ngeneration, it is because I found @System.Random@ to be unsatisfactory.\nWith @System.Random@, this program tended to return the same file\nrepeatedly.\n\nNote: on Unix, this program follows symbolic links, while on Windows, it\ndoesn't.  Symbolic links were introduced in Windows Vista and\nWindows Server 2008.";
