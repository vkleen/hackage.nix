The binding is thus likely to change in the next major\nrevision in what is perhaps the worst place. \\*\\*.\n\nChangelog\n\n0.3.0 to 0.4.0\n\n* LinearGradient type changed to be Vector4 VGfloat.\n\n* RadialGradient changed to (Vector4 VGfloat, VGfloat).\n\n* Removed Marshal and Unmarshal type classes, marshallBool and\nunmarshalBool moved out of the BasicTypes module.\n\n* Type change for colorRampStops.\n\n* Name change - maxStops changed to maxColorRampStops.\n\n* PathType(..) changed to PathAbsRel(..).\n\n* Substantial changes to Haddock docs.\n\n* Error handling in VGU redone - the original code in\nErrorsInternal was taken wholesale from Sven Panne\\'s\nOpenGL binding to help me bootstrap the OpenVG binding.\nRegrettably I forgot to replace it or attribute it -\nI've now replaced it. Sincere apologies to Sven Panne.";
