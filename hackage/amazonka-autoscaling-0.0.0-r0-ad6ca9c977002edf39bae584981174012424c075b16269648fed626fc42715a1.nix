Auto\nScaling is particularly well suited for applications that experience\nhourly, daily, or weekly variability in usage. Auto Scaling is enabled\nby Amazon CloudWatch and available at no additional charge beyond\nAmazon CloudWatch fees.\n\n/See:/ <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AutoScaling/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html AWS API Reference>\n\n/Warning:/ This is an experimental preview release which is still under\nheavy development and not intended for public consumption, caveat emptor!";
