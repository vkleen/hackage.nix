In particular, it enables the use of foreign libraries\nwithout a dedicated bridge or binding. Here is a tiny example:\n\n> nslog :: String -> IO ()\n> nslog msg = \$(objc ['msg :> ''String] (void [cexp| NSLog(@\"Here is a message from Haskell: %@\", msg) |]))\n\nFor more information, see <https://github.com/mchakravarty/language-c-inline/wiki>.\n\nKnown bugs: <https://github.com/mchakravarty/language-c-inline/issues>\n\n* New in 0.7.6: (1) Record marshalling; (2) foreign pointer-class marshalling; (3) custom type\nmarshallers. Generated _objc.m files now always include \"HsFFI.h\" (as the tool can generate type names\ndeclared in that header). Marshals 'Bool' as 'BOOL'. Marshal 'Int' and 'Word' to 'NSInteger' and\n'NSUInteger', respectively.\n\n* New in 0.6.0: Introduction of explicit marshalling hints (for more flexibility and support of\nGHC 7.8's untyped Template Haskell quotations)\n\n* New in 0.5.0: Marshalling of numeric types\n\n* New in 0.4.0: Maybe types are marshalled as pointers that may be nil & bug fixes.\n\n* New in 0.3.0: Boxed Haskell types without a dedicated type mapping are marshalled using stable\npointers.\n\n* New in 0.2.0: Support for multiple free variables in one inline expression as well\nas for inline code returning 'void'.\n\n* New in 0.1.0: We are just getting started!
