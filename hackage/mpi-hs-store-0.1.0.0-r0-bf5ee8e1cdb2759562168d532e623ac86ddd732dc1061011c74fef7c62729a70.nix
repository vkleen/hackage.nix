      description = "MPI (the [Message Passinag Interface](https://www.mpi-forum.org)) is\na widely used standard for distributed-memory programming on HPC\n(High Performance Computing) systems. MPI allows exchanging data\n(_messages_) between programs running in parallel. There are several\nhigh-quality open source MPI implementations (e.g. MPICH, MVAPICH,\nOpenMPI) as well as a variety of closed-source implementations.\nThese libraries can typically make use of high-bandwidth low-latency\ncommunication hardware such as InfiniBand.\n\nThis library @mpi-hs@ provides Haskell bindings for MPI. It is based\non ideas taken from\n[haskell-mpi](https://github.com/bjpop/haskell-mpi),\n[Boost.MPI](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_64_0/doc/html/mpi.html)\nfor C++, and [MPI for\nPython](https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).\n\n@mpi-hs@ provides two API levels: A low-level API gives rather\ndirect access to the actual MPI API, apart from certain \"reasonable\"\nmappings from C to Haskell (e.g. output arguments that are in C\nstored via a pointer are in Haskell regular return values). A\nhigh-level API simplifies exchanging arbitrary values that can be\nserialized.\n\nNote that the automated builds on\n[Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org) will currently always fail\nsince no system MPI library is present there. However, builds on\n[Stackage](https://www.stackage.org) should succeed -- if not, there\nis an error in this package.";
