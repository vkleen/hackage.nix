Instead, you can simply pass\naround functions or infinite data structures (or /very/ high-resolution data\nthat would be infeasible to handle in a strict language).\n\nHowever when you want to /view/ the data, it will eventually need to be exported out of Haskell\nin some finite form. The purpose of this library is to delay this discretisation\nas long as possible: it implements an interactive plotting window that accepts continuous/recursive\ndata and only &#x201c;flattens&#x201d; it according to the specific view configuration.\nYou can then zoom in to a shown diagram and it will automatically calculate\nthe features more detailedly, or zoom out and discover previosly unexpected\nfeatures. You don't need to worry about specifying the range and/or resolution beforehand:\nthe program will try to find a suitable default view based on /all/ data your displaying,\nand you can always still zoom, resize or move later.\n\n<http://projects.haskell.org/diagrams> are used as the &#x201c;pre-rendered&#x201d; type. This\nmakes the output usable in a very wide range of applications, though at the moment only the GTK\nwindow view is implemented.";
