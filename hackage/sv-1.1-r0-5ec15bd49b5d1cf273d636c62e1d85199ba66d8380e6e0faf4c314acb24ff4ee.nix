      description = "<<http://i.imgur.com/uZnp9ke.png>>\n\nsv (separated values) is a library for parsing, decoding, encoding, and\nprinting CSV and similar formats (such as PSV, TSV, and many more).\n\nsv uses an Applicative combinator style for decoding and encoding, rather\nthan a type class based approach. This means we can have multiple decoders\nfor the same type, multiple combinators of the same type, and we never have\nto worry about orphan instances. These decoders can be stitched together from\nprovided primitives and combinators, or you can build one from a parser\nfrom your favourite parser combinator library.\n\nFor parsing, sv uses <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hw-dsv hw-dsv>, a high performance streaming CSV parser based on rank-select data structures.\nsv works with UTF-8, and should work with CP-1252 as well. It does not work\nwith UTF-16 or UTF-32.\n\nsv returns values for all errors that occur - not just the first. Errors have\nmore structure than just a string, indicating what went wrong.\n\nsv tries not to be opinionated about how your data should look. We intend for\nthe user to have a great degree of freedom to build the right decoder for\ntheir dataset.\n\nParts of sv are intended to be imported as follows:\n\n@\nimport Data.Sv\nimport qualified Data.Sv.Decode as D\nimport qualified Data.Sv.Encode as E\n@\n\nExamples:\n\n* Decoding a real CSV: <https://github.com/qfpl/sv/blob/master/examples/src/Data/Sv/Example/Species.lhs Species.lhs>\n* Decoding by column name: <https://github.com/qfpl/sv/blob/master/examples/src/Data/Sv/Example/Columnar.hs Columnar.hs>\n* Encoding data to a CSV: <https://github.com/qfpl/sv/blob/master/examples/src/Data/Sv/Example/Encoding.hs Encoding.hs>\n* Handling NULL and Unknown occuring in a column of numbers: <https://github.com/qfpl/sv/blob/master/examples/src/Data/Sv/Example/Numbers.hs Numbers.hs>\n* Dealing with non-rectangular data: <https://github.com/qfpl/sv/blob/master/examples/src/Data/Sv/Example/Ragged.hs Ragged.hs>\n* Integrating with an existing attoparsec parser to read date stamps: <https://github.com/qfpl/sv/blob/master/examples/src/Data/Sv/Example/TableTennis.hs TableTennis.hs>\n\nTo get the best performance, the hw-dsv parser and its dependencies\nunderlying sv should be compiled with the flag @+bmi2@ to enable . These\nlibraries are:  @bits-extra@, @hw-rankselect@, @hw-rankselect-base@, and\n@hw-dsv@. A simple way to set the flags for all of them when building with\ncabal is to include a cabal.project file in your project containing\nsomething like the following:\n\n>packages: .\n>package bits-extra\n>  flags: +bmi2\n>package hw-rankselect\n>  flags: +bmi2\n>package hw-rankselect-base\n>  flags: +bmi2\n>package hw-dsv\n>  flags: +bmi2";
