A computation of type\n@Tube a b m r@ consumes values of type 'a' and produces values of type\n'b'.\n\nSpecialized @Tube@s exist which allow for stream branching, merging, and\nother non-linear control. These are @Source@, @Sink@, and @Channel@.\n\nAlso provided are @Pump@s, the comonadic dual to @Tube@s. Examples are\nprovided of how they can be used with @Tube@s but we have almost certainly\nonly scratched the surface.\n\nExamples and more information may be found at\n<https://github.com/gatlin/tubes>.\n\nI seem to have trouble uploading packages where the documentation can be\nbuilt correctly on Hackage. If I have (once again) messed this up, you can\nfind Haddock documentation at <https://niltag.net/tubes>. I apologize for\nany inconvenience!\n\nThis should compile on GHC 7.8, but the problem\nis that previous attempts at setting the versions properly rendered Hackage\nunable to generate documentation. Hopefully I have this fixed but any\nadvice is welcome.";
