A reactive value is a /typed mutable value with access properties and change propagation/. Access property can be read-only, read-write or read-write.\n\nHow an RV is actually implemented, and when and how change propagation is executed is dependent on each RV. For instance, Gtk widget properties would normally use the standard event-handler installers to implement change propagation, whereas pure Haskell values might fork a thread (or not) and propagate changes asynchronously.\n\nRVs can be created from pure models (see <https://github.com/keera-studios/keera-hails/tree/master/keera-hails-mvc-model-lightmodel keera-hails-mvc-model-lightmodel> and  <https://github.com/keera-studios/keera-hails/tree/master/keera-hails-mvc-model-protectedmodel keera-hails-mvc-model-protectedmodel>), Gtk+\\/WX\\/Qt\\/HTML DOM\\/Android widget properties\\/event handlers\\/getters\\/setters, files, sockets, FRP networks. Other backends are also available. See <https://github.com/keera-studios/keera-hails keera-hails> for a list of available backends, tutorials, etc.";
