From\n<http://gnuterrypratchett.com GNU Terry Pratchett>:\n\n> In Terry Pratchett's Discworld series, the clacks are a series of\n> semaphore towers loosely based on the concept of the telegraph. Invented\n> by an artificer named Robert Dearheart, the towers could send messages\n> \"at the speed of light\" using standardized codes. Three of these codes\n> are of particular import:\n>\n> G: send the message on\n> N: do not log the message\n> U: turn the message around at the end of the line and send it back again\n>\n> When Dearheart's son John died due to an accident while working on a\n> clacks tower, Dearheart inserted John's name into the overhead of the\n> clacks with a \"GNU\" in front of it as a way to memorialize his son forever\n> (or for at least as long as the clacks are standing.)\n>\n>\n> Keeping the legacy of Sir Terry Pratchett alive forever. For as long as\n> his name is still passed along the Clacks, Death can't have him.\n\nPlease see the\n<https://github.com/prikhi/wai-middleware-clacks/blob/master/README.md README>\nor\n<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/wai-middleware-clacks/docs/Network-Wai-Middleware-Clacks.html module documentation>\nfor usage instructions.";
