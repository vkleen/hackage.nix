Auto Scaling is\nparticularly well suited for applications that experience hourly, daily, or\nweekly variability in usage. Auto Scaling is enabled by Amazon CloudWatch and\navailable at no additional charge beyond Amazon CloudWatch fees.\n\n/See:/ <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AutoScaling/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html AWS API Reference>\n\n/Warning:/ This is an experimental preview release which is still under\nheavy development and not intended for public consumption, caveat emptor!";
