'EQ' is stored as @1@.\nThe type itself stores a Haskell enumeration element,\nsuch that GHC can apply all of its optimizations for enumerations.\nIt is not checked, whether the storage type @w@ is large enough\nto hold all admissible numeric values of @e@.\nIt is also not checked, whether the storage type @w@ supports negative values\nwhenever the enumeration of @e@ contains ones.\n\nSee the @bool8@ package for the special case of a 'Bool' stored in a 'Word8'.";
