It is implemented as a high-level wrapper around\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/bindings-libusb bindings-libusb>\nwhich is a low-level binding to the C library:\n<http://libusb.org/ libusb-1.*>.\n\nThe USB transfer functions in this library have a simple synchronous\ninterface (they block) but are implemented using the @libusb@\nasynchronous interface. They integrate with the GHC event manager\nmaking them efficient (no busy-loops) and interruptible (throwing an\nexception to the thread executing a transfer immediately cancels the\ntransfer).\n\nIf the GHC event manager is not available (because you're either not\nusing GHC or because you're on Windows) the library degrades\ngracefully to the @libusb@ synchronous implementation.\n\nThis documentation assumes knowledge of how to operate USB\ndevices from a software standpoint (descriptors, configurations,\ninterfaces, endpoints, control\\/bulk\\/interrupt\\/isochronous\ntransfers, etc). Full information can be found in the\n<http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/ USB 2.0 specification>.\n\nFor an example how to use this library see the\n<https://github.com/basvandijk/usb-example usb-example> package\nor the <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/ls-usb ls-usb> package.\n\nAlso see the <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/usb-safe usb-safe>\npackage which wraps this package and provides some strong safety\nguarantees for working with USB devices.\n\nFinally have a look at the\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/usb-iteratee usb-iteratee>\npackage which provides @iteratee@ enumerators for enumerating\nbulk, interrupt and isochronous endpoints:\n\nBesides this API documentation the following sources might be\ninteresting:\n\n* <http://libusb.sourceforge.net/api-1.0/ The libusb 1.0 documentation>.\n\n* <http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/ The USB 2.0 specification>.\n\n* <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/bindings-libusb The bindings-libusb documentation>.\n\n* <http://www.beyondlogic.org/usbnutshell/usb1.htm \"USB in a NutShell\">.";
