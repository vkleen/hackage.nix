Changing the datatype at the very least involves changing import statements across your program.\n\nThe package introduces classes to overload functions like \"getContents\", \"putStr\" over multiple datatypes, so implementations can be changed easily.\n\nAll the code documentation is in \"System.IO.StringLike.Impl\".\n\nAll the other modules are just re-exports.";
