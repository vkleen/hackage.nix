It's simple, constraint-less, yet slow.\n\n* __pull__: using @Fin n -> a@ representation, which fuses well,\nbut makes some programs hard to write. And\n\n* __data-family__: which allows lazy pattern matching\n\n* __inline__: which exploits how GHC dictionary inlining works, unrolling\nrecursion if the size of 'Vec' is known statically.\n\nAs best approach depends on the application, @vec@ doesn't do any magic\ntransformation. Benchmark your code.\n\nThis package uses [fin](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fin), i.e. not @GHC.TypeLits@, for indexes.\n\nSee [Hasochism: the pleasure and pain of dependently typed haskell programming](https://doi.org/10.1145/2503778.2503786)\nby Sam Lindley and Conor McBride for answers to /how/ and /why/.\nRead [APLicative Programming with Naperian Functors](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-54434-1_21)\nby Jeremy Gibbons for (not so) different ones.\n\n=== Similar packages\n\n* [linear](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/linear) has 'V' type,\nwhich uses 'Vector' from @vector@ package as backing store.\n@Vec@ is a real GADT, but tries to provide as many useful instances (upto @lens@).\n\n* [vector-sized](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector-sized)\nGreat package using @GHC.TypeLits@. Current version (0.6.1.0) uses\n@finite-typelits@ and @Int@ indexes.\n\n* [sized-vector](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/sized-vector) depends\non @singletons@ package. @vec@ isn't light on dependencies either,\nbut try to provide wide GHC support.\n\n* [fixed-vector](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fixed-vector)\n\n* [sized](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/sized) also depends\non a @singletons@ package. The @Sized f n a@ type is generalisation of\n@linear@'s @V@ for any @ListLike@.\n\n* [clash-prelude](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/clash-prelude)\nis a kitchen sink package, which has @CLaSH.Sized.Vector@ module.\nAlso depends on @singletons@.";
