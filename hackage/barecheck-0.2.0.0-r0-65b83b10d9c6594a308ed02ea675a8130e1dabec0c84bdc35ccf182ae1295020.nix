The implementations\nare NOT provided through the QuickCheck Arbitrary and\nCoArbitrary typeclasses; instead, they are provided through\nordinary, non-overloaded functions.  This avoids problems\nwith orphan instances.\n\nImplementations are provided through child modules of the\nmodule that provides the original type.  For example, for\n\"Data.Map\", look under \"Data.Map.Generators\",\n\"Data.Map.Shrinkers\", and \"Data.Map.Coarbitrary\".\nFor instance, a function that generates a Map is at\n'Data.Map.Generators.map', while a function providing\na coarbitrary implementation is at 'Data.Map.Coarbitrary.map'.\nObviously this can lead to name conflicts, both between\nmodules provided in this package and with other standard\nmodules, so keep this in mind when you do your imports.";
