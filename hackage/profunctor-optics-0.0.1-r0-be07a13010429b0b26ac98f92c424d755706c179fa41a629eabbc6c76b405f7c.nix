Some highlights:\n\nFull complement of isos, prisms, lenses, grates, affines, traversals, cotraversals, views, setters, folds, and more.\n\nComposable indexed or co-indexed variants of most of the above.\n\nCompact & straight-forward implementation. No inscrutable internal modules, lawless or otherwise ancillary typeclasses, or heavy type-level machinery.\n\nFully interoperable. All that is required to create optics (standard, indexable, or co-indexable) is the `profunctors` package. Optics compose with (.) from `Prelude` as is typical. If you want to provide profunctor optics for your own types in your own libraries, you can do so without incurring a dependency on this package. Conversions to & from the Van Laarhoven representations are provided for each optic type.\n\nWell-documented properties and exportable predicates for testing your own optics.\n\nSee the <https://github.com/cmk/profunctor-optics/blob/master/profunctor-optics/README.md Readme> file for more information.";
