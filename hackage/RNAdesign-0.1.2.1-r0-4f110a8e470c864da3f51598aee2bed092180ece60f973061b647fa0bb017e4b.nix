It will then run a Markov chain to\nfind a sequence that is optimal with regard to the structural\ntargets and the user-defineable optimization function.\n\nThe user can give different optimization criteria on the\ncommand line, akin to a simple calculator.\n\nFor more details please consult:\n<https://github.com/choener/RNAdesign/blob/master/README.md>\n\nYou can also run @RNAdesign --showmanual@ which will display\nthe same @README.md@.\n\n\n\nIf you find this program useful, please cite:\n\n@\nChristian Hoener zu Siederdissen, Stefan Hammer, Ingrid Abfalter, Ivo L.
