This is a waste of space in the filesystem\nand  also a waste of serialization time. but the worst consequence is that, when the serialized data is read,\nit allocates multiple copies for the same object when referenced multiple times. Because multiple referenced\ndata is very typical in a pure language such is Haskell, this means that the resulting data loose the beatiful\neconomy of space and processing time that referential transparency permits.\n\nEvery instance of Show/Read is also a instance of Data.RefSerialize.\n\nThis package allows the serialization and deserialization of large data structures without duplication of data, with\nthe result of optimized performance and memory usage. It is also useful for debugging purposes.\n\nThere are automatic derived instances for instances of Read/Show. Lists of non-chars have its own instance.\nThe deserializer contains a subset of Parsec.Token for defining deserializing parsers.\n\nthe serialized string has the form:\n\n@expr( var1, ...varn) where  var1=value1,..valn=valueN @\n\nso that the string can be EVALuated.\n\nSee demo.hs and tutorial.\n\nin this release:\n\n*  Proper trailing withespace handlling for instances of Read\n\n*  Error handllig for instances of Read.\n\nTo do:\n\n-derived instances for Data.Binary\n\n-serialization to/from ByteStings";
