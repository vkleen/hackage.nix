      description = "AWS OpsWorks\nWelcome to the /AWS OpsWorks API Reference/. This guide provides descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for AWS OpsWorks actions and data types, including common parameters and error codes.\nAWS OpsWorks is an application management service that provides an integrated experience for overseeing the complete application lifecycle. For information about this product, go to the <http://aws.amazon.com/opsworks/ AWS OpsWorks> details page.\n__SDKs and CLI__\nThe most common way to use the AWS OpsWorks API is by using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) or by using one of the AWS SDKs to implement applications in your preferred language. For more information, see:\n-   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html AWS CLI>\n-   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/opsworks/AWSOpsWorksClient.html AWS SDK for Java>\n-   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkfornet/latest/apidocs/html/N_Amazon_OpsWorks.htm AWS SDK for .NET>\n-   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-sdk-php-2/latest/class-Aws.OpsWorks.OpsWorksClient.html AWS SDK for PHP 2>\n-   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkforruby/api/ AWS SDK for Ruby>\n-   <http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/sdkforjavascript/ AWS SDK for Node.js>\n-   <http://docs.pythonboto.org/en/latest/ref/opsworks.html AWS SDK for Python(Boto)>\n__Endpoints__\nAWS OpsWorks supports the following endpoints, all HTTPS. You must connect to one of the following endpoints. Stacks can only be accessed or managed within the endpoint in which they are created.\n-   opsworks.us-east-1.amazonaws.com\n-   opsworks.us-west-1.amazonaws.com\n-   opsworks.us-west-2.amazonaws.com\n-   opsworks.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\n-   opsworks.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com\n-   opsworks.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com\n-   opsworks.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com\n-   opsworks.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com\n-   opsworks.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com\n-   opsworks.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com\n-   opsworks.sa-east-1.amazonaws.com\n__Chef Versions__\nWhen you call < CreateStack>, < CloneStack>, or < UpdateStack> we recommend you use the\n@\nConfigurationManager\n@\nparameter to specify the Chef version. The recommended and default value for Linux stacks is currently 12. Windows stacks use Chef 12.2. For more information, see <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/workingcookbook-chef11.html Chef Versions>.\nYou can specify Chef 12, 11.10, or 11.4 for your Linux stack. We recommend migrating your existing Linux stacks to Chef 12 as soon as possible.\n\nThe types from this library are intended to be used with\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka amazonka>, which provides\nmechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.\n\nUse of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.\nThis is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding\nde/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.\nThe provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries\nsuch as <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens lens> or\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core lens-family-core>.\n\nSee \"Network.AWS.OpsWorks\" or <https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/ the AWS Documentation>\nto get started.";
