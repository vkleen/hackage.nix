For example, exchanging @rax@ with @eax@ raises a compile time error rather than a code-generation time error.\n\n* Immediate values are automatically converted to smaller size if possible.\n\n* De Bruijn indices are used instead of named labels\n\n* Quickcheck tests: You can quickcheck your x86 processor!\nPlease report failures, there is a higher chance that the error is this library rather than in your processor.";
