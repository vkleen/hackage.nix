This\npackage provides iteratees based around /pipe/ operators for\nhooking together application components and directing data\nflow.  New users should see the tutorial in the \"Data.IterIO\"\nmodule documentation.  Highlights of the library include:\n\n* Heavy emphasis on ease of use, ease of learning, and\nuniformity of mechanism.\n\n* Copious documentation.\n\n* Consistent EOF and error handling to avoid resource leaks\nand other issues in corner cases.\n\n* A set of iteratee parsing combinators providing LL(*)\nparsing while generally not consuming large amounts of\nmemory for backtracking.\n\n* Seamless integration with attoparsec for LL(1) parsing.\n\nSee \"Data.IterIO\" for a discussion of the differences between\niterIO and the two previous iteratee implementations (iteratee\nand enumerator).";
