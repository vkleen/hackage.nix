For instance, we could use a @<link>@ tag to reference external Css,\nor we might insert the Css code /inline/ a @<style>@ tag.\n\nWe use simple tags to infer the deployment mechanism for a context of\nmarkup. The three deployment mechanisms provided include\n\n* /inline/ - the asset inserted between markup tags\n\n* /local/ - assets on the current server\n\n* /remote/ - assets referenced with a complete URI";
