As long as the performance data ends up in\nthe `logs/` directory, gipeda is happy.\n\nGipeda produces static pages. In fact, the (single) html file and the\naccompagning JavaScript code is completely static. Giepda just generates a\nlarge number of json files. This has the advantage of easy deployment: Just put\ngipeda in your webspace of copy the files to some static web hosting and you\nare done. This putts very little load on your server, is cache friendly and has\nno security problems.\n\nDo you want to see it live?
