A number of plugins offer dash docset\nlookup in editors such as Emacs and Vim.  By using this tool, one can\nconvert haskell package haddock(s) to docsets.\n\nThe major benefit of dash-haskell, is that once these docsets are built, dash tools\nprovide one of the few, if only solutions for offline, contextual, and project dependency\napproximate IDE documentation for Haskell.\n\nSummary:\n\n> \$ dash-haskell --help\n> Usage: dash-haskell [-p|--dbprovider <provider,args>] [-o|--output <dir>]\n>                     [-q|--quiet] [-c|--cabal <file.cabal>]\n>                     [-r|--cabal-constraints executable=name, ..] [packages]\n>   additional help is also available on arguments with \"dash-haskell help arg\"\n> Available options:\n>   -h,--help                Show this help text\n>   -p,--dbprovider <provider,args>\n>                            a ghc package db provider: cabal|ghc|dir\n>   -o,--output <dir>        the directory to write created docsets to\n>   -q,--quiet               set to quiet output\n>   -c,--cabal <file.cabal>  the cabal file to source package dependencies from\n>   -r,--cabal-constraints executable=name, ..\n>                            limit package results from a cabal file source, see\n>                            documentation\n>   packages                 a list of packages to specifically build, e.g.\n>                            either-1.0.1 text-1.2.0\n\n> \$ cd foo-1.2.0/\n> \$ dash-haskell -c foo.cabal -o docsets\n> db provider:\n>   lookup strategy: cabal sandbox db index\n>   cmd: cabal\n>   args: sandbox hc-pkg list\n>\n> processing: system-filepath-0.4.12\n>   writing files..\n>   writing plist..\n>   populating database..\n>   finished populating sqlite database..\n>\n> processing: system-fileio-0.3.14\n>   writing files..\n>   writing plist..\n>   populating database..\n>   finished populating sqlite database..\n>\n> processing: pipes-4.1.2\n>   writing files..\n>   writing plist..\n>   populating database..\n>   finished populating sqlite database..\n>\n> warning: failed to process: parsec-3.1.5\n> warning: path errors in pkg conf file:\n>  /home/jpf/local/cabal-sandboxes/dash-haskell/x86_64-linux-ghc-7.8.3-packages.conf.d/parsec-3.1.5-abf7e89cafe4e74712f678cea843c1c8.conf\n> with problem(s):\n>  missing: haddock interface file\n>  missing: html doc dir\n>\n> processing: sqlite-simple-0.4.8.0\n>   writing files..\n>   writing plist..\n>   populating database..\n>   finished populating sqlite database..\n>\n> \$\n\nNotice, the failure of parsec-3.1.5 is illustrated here to show that in this case, dash-haskell depends on haddock documentation being built for the requested package.
