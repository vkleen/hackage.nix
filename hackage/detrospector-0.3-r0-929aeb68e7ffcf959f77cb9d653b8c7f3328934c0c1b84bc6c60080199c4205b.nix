It associates each\n`k'-character substring of the source document with a probability\ndistribution for the next character.  These distributions are used to\niteratively pick new characters for output.  In other words, it samples a\nMarkov chain derived from the source document.\n\nRun `detrospector' `-?' for usage information.  The program has several\nmodes.  It can generate random text, or invent individual random words which\nare not found in a dictionary.  These modes require a chain file, which is\nbuilt from a source document in another mode.\n\nDesign goals include speed and full Unicode support.  I welcome suggestions\nand patches regarding any aspect of this program.\n\nNew in version 0.3:\n\n* Compatible with @hashable@ 1.2";
