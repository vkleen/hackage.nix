At runtime, the actual values are assigned to\nthe toplevel @flags_name@ constants.  Those can be used purely\nthroughout the program.\n\nAt the beginning of the @main@ function, @\$(initHFlags \"program\ndescription\")@ has to be called to initialize the flags.  All flags\nwill be initialized that are transitively reachable via imports from\n@main@.  This means, that any Haskell package can easily define\ncommand line flags with @HFlags@.  This feature is demonstrated by\n<http://github.com/errge/hflags/blob/master/examples/ImportExample.hs>.\n\nA simple example (more in the\n<http://github.com/errge/hflags/tree/master/examples> directory):\n\n@\n\\#!\\/usr\\/bin\\/env runhaskell\n\n&#x7b;-\\# LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell \\#-&#x7d;\n\nimport HFlags\n\n'defineFlag' \\\"name\\\" \\\"Indiana Jones\\\" \\\"Who to greet.\\\"\n'defineFlag' \\\"r:repeat\\\" (3 + 4 :: Int) \\\"Number of times to repeat the message.\\\"\n\nmain = do s <- \$(initHFlags \\\"Simple program v0.1\\\")\n&#x20;         sequence_ \$ replicate flags_repeat greet\n&#x20; where\n&#x20;   greet = putStrLn \$ \\\"Hello \\\" ++ flags_name ++ \\\", very nice to meet you!\\\"\n@\n\nAt @initHFlags@ time, the library also tries to gather flags out of\nenvironment variables.  @HFLAGS_verbose=True@ is equivalent to\nspecify --verbose=True.  This environment feature only works with\nlong options and the user has to specify a value even for Bools.";
