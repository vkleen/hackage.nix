Keyword arguments have several\nadvantages over positional arguments:\n\n* they can be supplied in arbitrary order\n* their names serve as documentation at call site\n* it is impossible to accidentally mix them up\n\nUnlike @newtype@ wrappers, keyword arguments don't pollute the global\nnamespace, don't require top-level definitions, and don't need to be\nexported.\n\nThis implementation of named parameters is typesafe, provides good type\ninference, descriptive type errors, and has no runtime overhead.\n\nExample usage:\n\n> import Named\n>\n> createSymLink :: \"from\" :! FilePath -> \"to\" :! FilePath -> IO ()\n> createSymLink (Arg from) (Arg to) = ...\n>\n> main = createSymLink ! #from \"/path/to/source\"\n>                      ! #to \"/target/path\"";
