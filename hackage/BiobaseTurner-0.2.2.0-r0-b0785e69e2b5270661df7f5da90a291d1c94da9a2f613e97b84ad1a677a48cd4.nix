If\nyou need to be able to export, send a mail.\n\nThis is the 2011 post-library split version, hence not\ndeprecated anymore.\n\nNOTE This is rather fragile as some files use different index\nenumerations, which we handle rather... simplistically. We\ncannot fix one asymmetry case in dnastack.dh, as we do not\nchange sources.\n\nBIG FAT WARNING indexing now depends on repa shapes and index\nrepresentations. (with a good reason coming soon). For now,\njust assume that this has performance benefits.";
