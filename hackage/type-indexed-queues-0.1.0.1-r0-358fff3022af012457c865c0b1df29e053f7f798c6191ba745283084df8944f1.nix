For instance, the second if-then-else works\non boolean /singletons/, and the @<=.@ function provides a\nproof of order along with its answer. The actual arithmetic\nis carried out at runtime on normal integers, rather than\nPeano numerals. These tricks are explained in more detail\n\"TypeLevel.Singletons\" and \"TypeLevel.Bool\".\n\nA typechecker plugin does most of the heavy lifting, although\nthere are some (small) manual proofs.\n\n= Uses of verified queues\nThe main interesting use of these sturctures is total traversable\nsorting (<https://github.com/treeowl/sort-traversable sort-traversable>).\nAn implementation of this is provided in \"Data.Traversable.Parts\". I'm\ninterested in finding out other uses for these kinds of structures.";
