In this example, @hello@ is defined as an 'option' with a\n@String@ argument, while @quiet@ is a boolean 'flag' (called 'switch').\n\nA parser can be used like this:\n\n@\ngreet :: Sample -> IO ()\ngreet (Sample h False) = putStrLn \$ \\\"Hello, \\\" ++ h\ngreet _ = return ()\n\nmain :: IO ()\nmain = execParser opts \\>\\>= greet\n&#x20; where\n&#x20;   opts = info (helper \\<*\\> sample)\n&#x20;     ( fullDesc\n&#x20;     & progDesc \\\"Print a greeting for TARGET\\\"\n&#x20;     & header \\\"hello - a test for optparse-applicative\\\" )\n@\n\nThe @greet@ function is the entry point of the program, while @opts@ is a\ncomplete description of the program, used when generating a help text. The\n'helper' combinator takes any parser, and adds a @help@ option to it (which\nalways fails).\n\nThe @hello@ option in this example is mandatory (since it doesn't have a\ndefault value), so running the program without any argument will display a\nhelp text:\n\n>hello - a test for optparse-applicative\n>\n>Usage: hello --hello TARGET [--quiet]\n>  Print a greeting for TARGET\n>\n>Available options:\n>  -h,--help                Show this help text\n>  --hello TARGET           Target for the greeting\n>  --quiet                  Whether to be quiet\n\ncontaining a short usage summary, and a detailed list of options with\ndescriptions.";
