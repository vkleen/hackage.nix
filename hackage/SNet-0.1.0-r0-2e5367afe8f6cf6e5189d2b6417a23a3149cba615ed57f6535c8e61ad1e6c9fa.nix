One-shot\ndata synchronisation is provided by the built-in syncrocell component.\n\nStreams are associated with record types; collections of data where each\nitem is uniquely identified by its name. Structural subtyping on these\nrecord types directs the flow of data through the streaming network.\n\nFor more information see: <http://www.snet-home.org>";
