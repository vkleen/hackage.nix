The term substitution, in connection with tilings,\ndescribes a simple but powerful method to produce tilings with many\ninteresting properties.\n\nThe main idea is to use a finite set of building blocks called prototiles,\nan expanding linear map (the inflation factor), and a rule how to dissect\neach scaled tile into copies of the original prototiles.\n\nFor some examples of substitution tilings, and a glossary of terminology,\nsee the /tilings encyclopedia/\nat <http://tilings.math.uni-bielefeld.de/>";
