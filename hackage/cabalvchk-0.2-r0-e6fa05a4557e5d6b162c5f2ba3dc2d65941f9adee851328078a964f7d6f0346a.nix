This utility produces no output (unless a third argument is\nspecified) and the return value is 0 if the constraints are met or non-zero\nif the constraints are not met (including if the package is not installed).\n\nChanges in 0.2:\n\n* Handles multiple package installations by returning 0 if any of the\ninstalled versions satisfies the constraints.\n";
