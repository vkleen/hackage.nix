You should use\nmake-hard-links only if the files won't be modified, only renamed,\nremoved, or created.\n\nThe author had a Maildir with lots of duplicated files, and in\nhis case make-hard-links was capable of reducing the space usage\nin 29% (as measured by \"du -hcs\" and \"du -hcs -l\"). As a final note,\nthis program currently has a high memory usage as it has to maintain\ninformation about all the files that are possibly duplicates in\nmemory at once (the author measured 1.7 GiB of memory for about\n300.000 files).";
