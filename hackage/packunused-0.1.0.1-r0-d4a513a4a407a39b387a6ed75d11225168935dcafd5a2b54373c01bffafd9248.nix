These @.import@ files together with Cabal's generated\npackage configuration meta-data is analyzed by @packunused@ to\ndetect potentially redundant package dependencies.\n\nIn order to use @packunused@ you have to configure the package as\nusual. See the example session below:\n\n> cabal clean\n> rm *.imports\n> cabal configure -O0 --disable-library-profiling\n> cabal build --ghc-option=-ddump-minimal-imports\n> packunused\n\nThe @-O0 --disable-library-profiling@ options are just to speed up\ncompilation. In some cases you might want to pass additional options\nto the @configure@ step, such as @--enable-benchmark@ or\n@--enable-tests@.\n\nWhen run, @packunused@ prints a report to standard output listing\nits findings for each component built. The following is an example\nfor the @packunused@ package itself, with a redundant dependency\nadded for demonstration on purpose:\n\n> detected package components\n> ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n>\n>  - executable(s): packunused\n>\n> (component names suffixed with '*' are not configured to be built)\n>\n> executable(packunused)\n> ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n>\n> The following package depencencies seem redundant:\n>\n>  - criterion-0.6.2.0-9dd4d764629a47662168743b2dfda9bc\n>";
