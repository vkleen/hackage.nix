Arbitrary R programs can allow for leakage of\ninformation beyond the output, and \"side-channel attacks\" where an adversary\nobserves this additional leakage and thereby undermines the privacy guarantees.\nTransformeR is a subset of the R language that can serve\nas a domain specifc language useful to write the needed data transformations and\nat the same time be more maneageable for preventing security weaknesses\nand side-channel attacks.";
