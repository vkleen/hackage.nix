Non-JavaDoc comments, and preprocessor directives\nthat the input might contain will not appear in the output.\nThe program may be used to test the parser and pretty printer\nin the way that when @idlppr@ reads a pretty-printed Web IDL source,\nthe output should be identical to the input.\n\nChanges from 1.1: the parser has been fixed to recognize outermost-declared\nscoped names (those starting with \"::\"), and allow for use of @DOMString@\nin typedefs and valuetypes, as the Web IDL working draft prescribes.";
