CTCPs are sent as a PRIVMSG or NOTICE, where the first\nand last characters as @\\\\001@ (SOH), and special bytes are escaped\nby encoding them into a two-byte sequence beginning with @\\\\020@\n(DLE). CTCPs consist of command name (typically in upper-case)\nfollowed by list of space-separated arguments, which may be empty.\n\nOne use of CTCPs supported by the vast majority of IRC clients today\nis the ACTION command, typically invoked with /me. For example, if\nthe user @foo@ in the channel @#bar@ were to issue\n\n> /me dances\n\neveryone in the channel would receive the message\n\n> :foo PRIVMSG #bar :\\001ACTION dances\\001\n\nOther common uses of CTCP include requesting the name and version of\na user's IRC client, their local time, determining ping times, and\ninitiating file transfers (DCC).\n\nCharacters are escaped as follows:\n\n[@\\\\000@ (NUL)] @\\\\020 \\\\060@ (\"0\")\n\n[@\\\\012@ (NL)]  @\\\\020 \\\\156@ (\"n\")\n\n[@\\\\015@ (CR)]  @\\\\020 \\\\162@ (\"r\")\n\n[@\\\\020@ (DLE)] @\\\\020 \\\\020@\n\nAll other appearences of the escape character are errors, and are\ndropped.\n\nSee <http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/rfc/ctcpspec.html> for more\ndetails.";
