This approach allows hashed passwords to be stored in a single field that can also be used by non-Haskell applications, and makes it easy to implement a policy of updating passwords hashed to an old policy next time the plaintext password is available.\nThe OpenWall version of the C source for bcrypt (modified so it will build on all platforms without any assembler code) is included in this package.";
