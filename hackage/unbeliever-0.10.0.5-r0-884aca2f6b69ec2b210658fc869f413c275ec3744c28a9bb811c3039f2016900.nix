Its @Program@ type provides unified ouptut &\nlogging, command-line option parsing, exception handling, and a place to\nput top-level application state. There's also an underlying @Rope@ text\ntype built on a finger tree of UTF-8 fragments along with conveniences\nfor pretty printing and colourizing terminal output.\n\nA description of this package, a list of features, and some background\nto its design is contained in the\n<https://github.com/oprdyn/unbeliever/blob/master/README.markdown README>\non GitHub.\n\nUseful starting points in the documentation are\n<../core-program/docs/Core-Program-Execute.html Core.Program.Execute> and\n<../core-text/docs/Core-Text-Rope.html Core.Text.Rope>.\n\nAn ancillary purpose of this library is to facilitate interoperability\nbetween different package families and ecosystems. Having a single\nbatteries-included package (as was originally the case) made using it\neasier, but the resulting dependency footprint was considerable and\ngrowing. The code is thus now spread across several packages:\n\n* __core-text__\n* __core-data__\n* __core-program__\n\nwith more forthcoming as we continue to add convenince and\ninteroperability wrappers around streaming, webservers, and database\naccess patterns.";
