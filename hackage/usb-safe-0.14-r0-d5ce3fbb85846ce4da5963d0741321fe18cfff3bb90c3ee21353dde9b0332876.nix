For example doing I/O with a closed device or reading from\nor writing to an endpoint which doesn't belong to the claimed\ninterface. Or reading from an Out endpoint or writing to an In\nendpoint.\n\n@usb-safe@ provides the following guarantees:\n\n* You can't reference handles to devices that are closed. In other words: no\nI/O with closed handles is possible.\n\n* The programmer specifies the /region/ in which devices should remain open. On\nexit from the region the opened devices will be closed automatically.\n\n* You can't reference handles to configurations that have not been set.\n\n* You can't reference handles to interfaces that have not been claimed.\n\n* Just like with devices, the programmer can specify the region in\nwhich interfaces should remain claimed. On exit from the region\nthe claimed interfaces will be released automatically.\n\n* You can't reference handles to alternates that have not been set.\n\n* You can't reference endpoints that don't belong to a setted alternate.\n\n* You can't read from an endpoint with an Out transfer direction.\n\n* You can't write to an endpoint with an In transfer direction.\n\nThe primary technique used in usb-safe is called \\\"Lightweight monadic\nregions\\\" which was invented by Oleg Kiselyov and Chung-chieh Shan.\nSee:\n\n<http://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/regions.html#light-weight>\n\nThis technique is implemented in the @regions@ package which is\nre-exported from @usb-safe@.\n\nSee the @usb-safe-examples@ package for examples how to use this library:\n\n@git clone <https://github.com/basvandijk/usb-safe-examples>@";
