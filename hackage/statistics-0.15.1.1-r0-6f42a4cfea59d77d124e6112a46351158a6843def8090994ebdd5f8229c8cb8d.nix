(There are dozens of exotic distributions in use;\nwe focus on the most common.)\n\n* Computing with sample data: quantile estimation, kernel density\nestimation, histograms, bootstrap methods, significance testing,\nand regression and autocorrelation analysis.\n\n* Random variate generation under several different distributions.\n\n* Common statistical tests for significant differences between\nsamples.";
