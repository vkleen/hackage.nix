The package has three modules, @Pipes.Text@ , @Pipes.Text.Encoding@ and @Pipes.Text.IO@; the division has more or less the significance it has in the @text@ library.\n\nNote that the module @Pipes.Text.IO@ is present as a convenience (as is @Data.Text.IO@).  Official pipes IO would use @Pipes.ByteString@ together with the bytestring decoding functions in @Pipes.Text.Encoding@.  In particular, the @Pipes.Text.IO@ functions use Text exceptions.\n\n@Pipes.Text.IO@ uses version 0.11.3 or later of the @text@ library. It thus works with the version of @text@ that came with the 2013 Haskell Platform. To use an older @text@, install with the flag @-fnoio@";
