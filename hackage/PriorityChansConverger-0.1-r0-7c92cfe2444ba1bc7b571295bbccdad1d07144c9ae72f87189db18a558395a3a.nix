System selects a nonempty channel, whose (CurrentPriority,\nStartPriority) tuple is max. The side effect of the channel selection\nis it's /CurrentPriority/ decrease by one, if it's value becomes\nless than one, then the /CurrentPriority/ is set to /StartPriority/.\n\nFor the main API interface:\n\n@import Control.Concurrent.PriorityChansConverger@\n\nThe realization probably isn't\nvery fast and isn't good at memory economy, since it uses fresh high\nlevel primitive - STM. It wasn't intended to be used\nwith millions of channels. But it's max throughput comparing to the\nordinary @Chan@ throughput is to be estimated (will do it in some\nfuture version).";
