The loader just about does the job\nbut error handling is a bit crap at the moment.\n\n'CommandComponents' for the component functions used in the HsSqlSystem\nexe.\n\n'ChaosExtensions' for the experimental plpgsql syntax extensions.\n\nComes with command line access to some\nfunctions via a exe called HsSqlSystem, run this file with no\narguments to get some help. Has a HUnit test suite which you can\nrun using the HsSqlSystem executable. for the time being you can\nlook at the source of this command to see what it can do:\n\n<http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~jakewheat/hssqlppp/trunk/annotate/head:/HsSqlSystem.lhs>\n\nSee the project page\n<https://launchpad.net/hssqlppp> for more information and\ndocumentation links.\n\nThe test files for parsing and for type checking contain examples\nof what parses/ typechecks and what the asts and annotations look\nlike:\n\n<http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~jakewheat/hssqlppp/trunk/annotate/head:/Database/HsSqlPpp/Tests/ParserTests.lhs>\n\n<http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~jakewheat/hssqlppp/trunk/annotate/head:/Database/HsSqlPpp/Tests/TypeCheckTests.lhs>";
