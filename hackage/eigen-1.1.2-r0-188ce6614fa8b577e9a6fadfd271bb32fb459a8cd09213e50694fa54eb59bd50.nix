Common questions about the MPL2 are answered in the official MPL2 FAQ at <http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/FAQ.html>.\n\nNote that currently, a few features in Eigen rely on third-party code licensed under the LGPL: SimplicialCholesky, AMD ordering, and constrained_cg. Such features are explicitly disabled by compiling Eigen with the EIGEN_MPL2_ONLY preprocessor symbol defined.\n\nVirtually any software may use Eigen. For example, closed-source software may use Eigen without having to disclose its own source code. Many proprietary and closed-source software projects are using Eigen right now, as well as many BSD-licensed projects.\n\nSome parts of documentation strings are based or replicate original Eigen documentation which is available at <http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/>.";
