The YUI bundle can be embedded in compiled code with\nTemplate Haskell (install with @-fembed@) which means the files are\nserved directly from memory, and also that you can compile and deploy a\nsingle executable without having to worry about deploying the YUI files\nas well.\n\nThe benefits of using this over the Yahoo! CDN is that you can work\noffline and that you can host YUI yourself without sacrificing the\nbenefits of \\\"combo loading\\\".\n\nThe versioning scheme of this package is that the first part is the\ntargeted Happstack series plus the bundled YUI version, such that 7351\nmeans \\\"Happstack 7, YUI 3.5.1\\\".  The second part is the major version\nof this package itself, as defined by the Package Versioning Policy.\n\nThe package also includes some utilities for working with the YUI CSS\nmodules.  In a future release, the plan is to add more utilities, for\nexample a combo handler for YUI modules written using JMacro, a bridge\nbetween HSX and YUI Node objects and tools for making it easier to work\nwith modules like Uploader and Pjax.\n\nFor an example application, see:\n<https://github.com/dag/happstack-yui/blob/master/demo/happstack-yui-demo.hs>";
