CDB files can contain multiple values for a\ngiven key.\n\nFor more information on the CDB file format, please see: <http://cr.yp.to/cdb.html>\n\nPlease note, that there is another pure Haskell CDB library on Hackage:\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hs-cdb>, using memory mapped bytestrings for IO.\nIt served as an inspiration for this package.";
