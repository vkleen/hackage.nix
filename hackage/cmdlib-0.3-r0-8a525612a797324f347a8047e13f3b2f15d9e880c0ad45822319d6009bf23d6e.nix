Supports complex interfaces with many\noptions and commands, with option & command grouping, with simple\nand convenient API. Even though quite powerful, it strives to keep\nsimple things simple. The library uses \"System.Console.GetOpt\" as\nits backend.\n\nIn comparison to the other commandline handling libraries:\n\nCompared to cmdargs, cmdlib has a pure attribute system and is\nbased on GetOpt for help formatting & argument parsing. Cmdlib may\nalso be more extendable due to typeclass design, and can use\nuser-supplied types for option arguments.\n\nCmdargs >= 0.4 can optionally use a pure attribute system,\nalthough this is clearly an add-on and the API is a second-class\ncitizen in relation to the impure version.\n\nGetOpt and parseargs both require explicit flag representation, so\nthey live a level below cmdlib. GetOpt is in fact used as a\nbackend by cmdlib.";
