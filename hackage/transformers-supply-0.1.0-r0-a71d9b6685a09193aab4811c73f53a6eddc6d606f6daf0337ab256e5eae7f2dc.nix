The former\nprovides an applicative and applicative transformer, the latter a monad and\nmonad transformer.\n\nThe reason for providing two separate implementations is that the\n@Applicative@ instance of @Control.Monad.Trans.Supply.SupplyT@ incurs a\n@Monad@ constraint on the wrapped type, meaning it's not possible to\n(usefully) wrap a type that only has an @Applicative@ instance.\n\nThe implementation of @Control.Applicative.Supply.SupplyT@ has an\n@Applicative@ instance for wrapped types that are only @Applicative@, but\nthis implementation cannot be made an instance of @Monad@, meaning it is\nless powerful than the version from @Control.Monad.Trans.Supply@.\n\nIn general, use @Control.Monad.Trans.Supply@ unless you're wrapping a type\nthat has no @Monad@ instance, in which case you can fall back to\n@Control.Applicative.Supply@.";
