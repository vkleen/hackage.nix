This library uses a haskell implementation of ICMP\nrather than invoking `/bin/ping`. This avoids the costly process of starting\na child process. Additionally, there are greater opportunities for reusing\nsockets. The cost of this is that the user must ensure that one of these\nis true:\n\n* The kernel parameter `net.ipv4.ping_group_range` has been configured\nto allow pings to all IP addresses. (preferred solution)\n\n* The process is running with the the `CAP_NET_RAW` capability.\n\n* The process is running as root. (worst solution)\n";
