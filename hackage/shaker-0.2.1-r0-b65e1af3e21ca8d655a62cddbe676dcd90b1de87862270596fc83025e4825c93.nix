Shaker will read cabal configuration to discover source directories, compilation options and targets to compile.\n\n/Usage/\n\nThe cabal configuration file should be generated beforehand with /runhaskell Setup.hs configure/. If you change your cabal configuration, you need to recreate the configuration file.\n\n/Execution/\n\nIn the root of your haskell project, launch shaker. An interactive prompt will allow you to execute differents action.\n\n/Action execution/\n\n[@Simple Execution@] An action can be launched normally, by entering the action name\n\n[@Multiple action execution@] You can specify multiple action to execute simply by separating action by spaces.\n\n[@Continuous Action@] A continuous action will execute the action when a changement on files has been detected.\nEvery action are elligible to continuous action, you simply need to prefix them with '~'\n\n/Available actions/\n\n[@Compile@] Compile the project. Targets of the compilation are main file (in case of executable) or exposed modules (in case of library).\n\n[@FullCompile@] Compile all hs files found in source directory. It is usefull to compile test sources.\n\n[@Clean@] Clean the directory containing .o and .hi files.\n\n[@Quit@] Exit the application.\n\n/Examples/\n\n[@% Compile@] Simply compile the project\n\n[@% Clean Compile@] Clean and compile the project\n\n[@% ~Compile@] Switch to continuous mode and will compile the project when sources are modified.\n\n[@% ~Clean Compile@] Switch to continuous mode and will clean and compile the project when sources are modified.";
