      description = "This package provides a general purpose Haskell XML library using Expat to\ndo its parsing (<http://expat.sourceforge.net/> - a fast stream-oriented XML\nparser written in C).  It is extensible to any string type, with @String@,\n@ByteString@ and @Text@ provided out of the box.\n\nBasic usage: Parsing a tree (/Tree/), formatting a tree (/Format/).\n\nOther features: Helpers for processing XML trees (/Proc/), trees annotated with\nXML source location (/Annotated/), XML cursors (/Cursor/), more intelligent\nhandling of qualified tag names (/Qualified/), tags qualified with namespaces\n(/Namespaced/), SAX-style parse (/SAX/), and access to the low-level interface\nin case speed is paramount (/IO/).  And, /NodeClass/ contains type classes for\ngeneralized tree processing.\n\nThe design goals are speed, speed, speed, interface simplicity and modularity\n(in that order).\n\nFor introduction and examples, see the /Text.XML.Expat.Tree/ module. For benchmarks,\n<http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Hexpat/>\n\nThis package provides pure lazy parsing.  However, Haskell's lazy I\\/O is\nproblematic in some applications because it doesn't handle I\\/O errors properly\nand can give no guarantee of timely resource cleanup.  In these cases, chunked\nI\\/O is a better approach: Take a look at the /hexpat-iteratee/ package.\n\nCredits to Iavor Diatchki and the @xml@ (XML.Light) package for /Proc/ and /Cursor/.\n\nINSTALLATION: Unix install requires an OS package called something like @libexpat-dev@.\nOn MacOSX, expat comes with Apple's optional X11 package, or you can install it from source.\nTo install on Windows, first install the Windows binary that's available from\n<http://expat.sourceforge.net/>, then type (assuming you're using v2.0.1):\n\n@cabal install hexpat --extra-lib-dirs=\"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Expat 2.0.1\\\\Bin\" --extra-include-dirs=\"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Expat 2.0.1\\\\Source\\\\Lib\"@\n\nEnsure @libexpat.dll@ can be found in your system PATH (or copy it into your executable's directory).\n\nChangeLog: 0.15 changes intended to fix a (rare) \\\"error: a C finalizer called back into Haskell.\\\"\nthat seemed only to happen only on ghc6.12.X; 0.15.1 Fix broken Annotated parse.";
