MIDA is not interactive in sense that you cannot control result of\nits activity in real time, it is intended for producers and should be used\nwith a DAW. MIDA can help you create variative elements in your music in a\nvery simple way. Since MIDI can control a lot of different instruments,\npower of MIDA is truly great.\nMain reason for MIDA development is to create software tool that can be\nused in such a way that does not change established workflow, so people\ncould use familiar plugins and software instruments.\nThe core concept of MIDA is building systems with complex behaviors from\nvery basic and easy-to-understand elements and powerful means of their\ncomposition.\nCurrently MIDA can be used to translate source files into .mid files, and\nalso in interactive mode that will help you to understand how MIDA\nlanguage works.\nSee MIDA Manual for more information.";
