In spite of this richer data model, queries are\ntransformed into SQL to run against standard databases.\n\nTo use the language, express a query using the combinators\nlike @foreach@, @table@, @having@, @singleton@ and so on.\nWrap this in a call to @narcToSQLString@ to get a string\nthat can be sent to a SQL database.\n\nTo send a query directly to an HDBC connection, import\nthe module @Database.Narc.HDBC@ and use its @run@ function,\npassing it an HDBC connection and a Narc query. The result\nis an IO action that returns a 2-D list of result values\nin HDBC's usual format.";
