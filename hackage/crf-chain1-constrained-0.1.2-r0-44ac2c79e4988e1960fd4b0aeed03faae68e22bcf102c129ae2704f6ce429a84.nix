Here, on the other hand, such features do not influence\nthe overall probability of the (sentence, labels) pair - they are\nassigned the default potential of 0.\n\nEfficient algorithm for determining marginal probabilities of individual\nlabels is provided.\nThe tagging is performed with respect to marginal probabilities.";
