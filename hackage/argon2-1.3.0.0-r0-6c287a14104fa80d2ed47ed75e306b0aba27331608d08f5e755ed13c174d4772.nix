The API exposed by this bindings provide access to the 3 specified variants\n\n* @Argon2d@ (maximize resistance to GPU cracking attacks),\n* @Argon2i@ (optimized to resist side-channel attacks), and\n* @Argon2id@ (hybrid version combining @Argon2d@ and @Argon2i@)\n\nand allows to control various parameters (time cost, memory cost, parallelism) of the Argon2 function. Moreover, it is also supported to generate and verify the deprecated version 1.0 hashes, as well as the current version 1.3 hashes.\n\nThe Haskell API supports both raw binary hashes as well as the ASCII-based [PHC string format](https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-string-format/blob/master/phc-sf-spec.md).\n\nThis version provides bindings to the \\\"@20171227@\\\" release of the [Argon2 reference implementation (libargon2)](https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2) of the Argon2 password-hashing function.\n\nPlease refer to the [Argon2 specification](https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2/blob/master/argon2-specs.pdf) for more information.";
