There is no\n> need to manually run commands or keep track of tag files. Just open any Haskell\n> file in Vim and the Tagbar window will instantly show an interactive browsable\n> list of all the functions and declarations in the file. This window also\n> updates automatically as you edit the file.\n>\n> The tags created by lushtags are marked with several extensions, so that when\n> used with Tagbar you get these features:\n>\n> - Type signatures are displayed for functions.\n> - Tags are properly scoped so that, for example, data declarations appear as a\n>   tree with their constructors scoped as children.\n> - Definitions that are exported from the module are marked as \"public\" and\n>   appear emphasized in Tagbar.\n> - Tag locations are internally stored as patterns, not line numbers, so that\n>   you can correctly jump to tags even if they have moved in the source code\n>   during editing.\n>\n> ![screenshot](https://github.com/bitc/lushtags/raw/master/doc/screenshot-tagbar-2011-09-19.png)\n>\n> [1]: http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hasktags\n> [2]: http://kingfisher.nfshost.com/sw/gasbag/\n> [3]: http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hothasktags\n> [4]: http://majutsushi.github.com/tagbar/";
