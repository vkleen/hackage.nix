Useful for derived @Enum@s, newtype'd @Int@s, or any data type\nthat can be packed into an @Int@: just implement @fromEnum@ and @toEnum@.\n\nThe boilerplate is generated using Template Haskell, so unlike\n@enummapset@ it's easier to maintain and keep up-to-date with\n@containers@. On the downside, it's less portable.\n\nNote that \"Data.EnumMap.Lazy\" and \"Data.EnumMap.Strict\" provide distinct\nnewtype wrappers, and their respective 'Functor' instances behave as\nexpected, unlike that of @IntMap@ which is alway lazy.";
