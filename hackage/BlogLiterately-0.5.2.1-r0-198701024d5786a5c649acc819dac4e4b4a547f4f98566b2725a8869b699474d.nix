In\nparticular, it is easy to create your own executable\nwhich adds extra custom transformations; see\n\"Text.BlogLiterately.Run\".\n\nNote that BlogLiterately depends on blaze-html-0.5.\nPandoc 1.9.3 and later can depend on either\nblaze-html-0.4 or blaze-html-0.5, but the latter only\nin case the blaze_html_0_5 flag is set.  If pandoc is\ninstalled as a dependency of BlogLiterately,\neverything should work out fine, since cabal's\nconstraint solver will figure out to set that flag.\nBut if pandoc is already installed against\nblaze-html-0.4 you may need to reinstall it with the\nblaze_html_0_5 flag explicitly set.";
