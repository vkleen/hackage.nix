      description = "Redis is an open source, advanced key-value store. It is often referred to\nas a data structure server since keys can contain strings, hashes, lists,\nsets and sorted sets. This library is a Haskell client for the Redis\ndatastore. Compared to other Haskell client libraries it has some\nadvantages:\n\n[Compatibility with Latest Stable Redis:] Hedis is intended\nto be used with the latest stable version of Redis (currently 3.2).\nMost redis commands (<http://redis.io/commands>) are available as\nhaskell functions, although MONITOR and SYNC are intentionally\nomitted. Additionally, a low-level API is\nexposed that  makes it easy for the library user to implement further\ncommands, such as new commands from an experimental Redis version.\n\n[Automatic Optimal Pipelining:] Commands are pipelined\n(<http://redis.io/topics/pipelining>) as much as possible without any\nwork by the user. See\n<http://informatikr.com/2012/redis-pipelining.html> for a\ntechnical explanation of automatic optimal pipelining.\n\n[Enforced Pub\\/Sub semantics:] When subscribed to the Redis Pub\\/Sub server\n(<http://redis.io/topics/pubsub>), clients are not allowed to issue\ncommands other than subscribing to or unsubscribing from channels. This\nlibrary uses the type system to enforce the correct behavior.\n\n[Connect via TCP or Unix Domain Socket:] TCP sockets are the default way to\nconnect to a Redis server. For connections to a server on the same\nmachine, Unix domain sockets offer higher performance than the standard\nTCP connection.\n\nFor detailed documentation, see the \"Database.Redis\" module.\n";
