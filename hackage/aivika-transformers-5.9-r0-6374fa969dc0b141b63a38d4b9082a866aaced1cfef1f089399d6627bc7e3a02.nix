Therefore, there are additional packages\nthat allow saving the results of distributed simulation in SQL databases\nand only then the simulation reports are generated. These reports are HTML pages\nwith charts, histograms, links to CSV tables, statistics summary and so on.\n\nThis method can be used not only for the parallel distributed simulation, but also for other\nsimulation models created with help of the generalized version of the Aivika simulation library.\nPlease consult the AivikaSoft [4] website for more details.\n\n\\[1] <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/aivika>\n\n\\[2] <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/aivika-branches>\n\n\\[3] <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/aivika-distributed>\n\n\\[4] <http://www.aivikasoft.com>\n";
