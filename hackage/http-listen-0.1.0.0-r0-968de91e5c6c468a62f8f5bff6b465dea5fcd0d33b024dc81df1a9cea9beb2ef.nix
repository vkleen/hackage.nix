It could send a POST request\nwhenever a commit is made, or a new repository is created. You then set up a\nprogram that listens to these POSTs and reacts by reporting them to the\nproject's IRC channel or a mailing list.\n\nMost HTTP packages assume a typical web server which handles requests by\nreturning HTTP responses. This package tries to fill a gap by providing an\nAPI for simple listeners which don't necessarily serve web pages, and can do\nthings like reporting to IRC.\n\nSome features are missing and will be added soon:\n\n* Connection timeouts\n\n* Logging (currently errors are written to stdout, no other logging done)";
