At the moment, it implements a bunch of fairly random\nloop micro-kernels and a couple of small array algorithms. It will\ninclude many more benchmarks in the future.\n\nIn its present state, NoSlow /cannot/ be used to reliably compare the\nperformance of the benchmarked libraries. It can be quite helpful for\nidentifying cases where a closer inspection of the generated code\nmight be warranted, however.\n\nThe package builds two binaries: @noslow@ and @noslow-table@.\n\n[@noslow -o log@] runs the benchmarks and writes the results to 'log'\n\n[@noslow-table log -o table.html --html@] outputs the results from\n@log@ as a HTML table.\n\n[@noslow-table log -o table.html --raw --csv@] outputs the results\nfrom @log@ as a CSV file suitable for importing into spreadsheets.\n\n[@noslow-table --diff log1 log2@ -o table.html@] produces a table\ncomparing the results from 'log1' and 'log2' (2 means the first run was\n2x slower than the second; 0.5 means 2x faster).\n\n[@noslow-table --help@] lists additional options.\n\nNoSlow is described in more detail here:\n<http://unlines.wordpress.com/2009/11/27/noslow/>.\n\nChanges since version 0.1\n\n* Renamed and reorganised loop kernels\n\n* Several small array algorithms organised in the new\nbenchmark category @mini@\n\n* More reliable benchmark execution\n\n* Support for producing CSV files\n";
