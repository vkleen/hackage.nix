Currently, there are two backends:\n(1) an interpreter that serves as a reference\nimplementation of the intended semantics of the\nlanguage and (2) a CUDA backend generating code for\nCUDA-capable NVIDIA GPUs.\n\nTo use the CUDA backend, you need to have CUDA version 3.x\ninstalled.  The CUDA backend currently doesn't support 'Char'\nand 'Bool' arrays.\n\nAn experimental OpenCL backend is available at <https://github.com/HIPERFIT/accelerate-opencl>\nand an experimental multicore CPU backend building on the Repa array library\nis available at <https://github.com/blambo/accelerate-repa>.\n\nKnown bugs: <https://github.com/AccelerateHS/accelerate/issues>\n\n* New in 0.12.0.0: Full sharing recovery in scalar expressions and array\ncomputations. Two new example applications in package accelerate-examples:\nReal-time Canny edge detection and fluid flow simulator (both including a\ngraphical frontend). Bug fixes.\n\n* New in 0.11.0.0: New functions zip3, zip4, unzip3, unzip4, fill,\nenumFromN, enumFromStepN, tail, init, drop, take, slit, gather,\ngatherIf, scatter, scatterIf, and shapeSize.  New simplified AST\n(in package accelerate-backend-kit) for backend writers who want to\navoid the complexities of the type-safe AST.\n* New in 0.10.0.0: Complete sharing recovery for scalar expressions (but\ncurrently disabled by default). Also bug fixes in array sharing recovery\nand a few new convenience functions.\n\n* New in 0.9.0.0: Streaming, precompilation, Repa-style indices, stencils,\nmore scans, rank-polymorphic fold, generate, block I/O & many bug fixes\n\n* New in 0.8.1.0: Bug fixes and some performance tweaks\n\n* New in 0.8.0.0: 'replicate', 'slice' and 'foldSeg' supported in the\nCUDA backend; frontend and interpreter support for 'stencil'; bug fixes\n\n* New in 0.7.1.0: the CUDA backend and a number of scalar functions\n\nFor documentation, see the homepage and <https://github.com/AccelerateHS/accelerate/wiki>.";
