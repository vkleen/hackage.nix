In other words\nthe library expects to communicate with an XBee modem that has AP\nparameter = 2, indicating API frames with HDLC-like escape characters.\nThis mode provides for 8-bit transparent operation and is described in\nSection 6 of <ftp://ftp1.digi.com/support/documentation/90000866_C.pdf>.\n\nThe library code is 100% pure; nothing here depends on the\nIO monad and no particular modem device is assumed.  The code\ndepends on the @cereal@ package for serialization but is otherwise\npretty standard.  The test suite is based on @QuickCheck@ properties.";
