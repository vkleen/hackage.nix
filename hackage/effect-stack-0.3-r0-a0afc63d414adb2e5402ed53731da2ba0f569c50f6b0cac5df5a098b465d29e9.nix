It\nprovides a separate stack for each kind of effect; you may\nthen disambiguate by depth within each stack. For example,\nin a stack with two @StateT@ transformers, one can write\n\n@foo :: MonadStateDepth 0 m a => m a\nfoo = depthState \\@0 get@\n\nfor access to the topmost state effects, or\n\n@bar :: MonadStateDepth 1 m a => m a\nbar = depthState \\@1 get@\n\nfor access to the state from underneath the topmost\n@StateT@, no matter how deep in the stack the two\n@StateT@s are.\n\nSee the readme for more detailed motivation, usage\nexamples, and documentation.";
