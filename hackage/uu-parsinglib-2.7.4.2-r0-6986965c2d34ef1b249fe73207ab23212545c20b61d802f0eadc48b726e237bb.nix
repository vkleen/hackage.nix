      description = "New version of the Utrecht University parser combinator library, which  provides online, error correction,\nannotation free, applicative style parser combinators. In addition to this we do  provide a monadic and idomatic interface.\nParsers do analyse themselves to avoid commonly made errors. A recent addition was the combinator @`<||>`@ and\nassociates, which generalise merging and permuting parsers.\n\nThis version is based on the module \"Data.Listlike\", and as a result a great variety of input structures (@Strings@, @ByteStrings@, etc.)\ncan be handled.\n\nThe modules \"Text.ParserCombinators.UU.Demo.Examples\", \"Text.ParserCombinators.UU.Idioms\" and \"Text.ParserCombinators.UU.Demo.MergeAndpermute\"\ncontain a ready-made  @show_examples@  function,\nwhich can be called (e.g. from @ghci@) to see e.g. the error correction at work. It contains extensive haddock documentation, so why not just take a look                           to see the correction process at work, and to get a feeling for how the various combinators can be used?\n\nThe file \"Text.ParserCombinators.UU.CHANGELOG\" contains a log of the most recent changes and additions.\n\nThe file \"Text.ParserCombinators.UU.README\" contains some references to background information.\n\nWe maintain a low frequency mailing for discussing the package.
