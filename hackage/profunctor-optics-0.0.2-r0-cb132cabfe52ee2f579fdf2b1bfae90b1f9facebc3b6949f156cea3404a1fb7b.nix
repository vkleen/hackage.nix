All that is required to create optics is the `profunctors` package. Optics compose with (.) from `Prelude` as is typical. Conversions to & from the Van Laarhoven representations are provided for each optic type.\n\nWell-documented properties and exportable predicates for testing your own optics.\n\nSee the <https://github.com/cmk/profunctor-optics/blob/master/profunctor-optics/README.md Readme> file for more information.";
