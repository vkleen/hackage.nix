It makes no\nassumptions on how these payloads are sent or received and performs no\ncode generation. Types may specify how to be serialized and deserialized\nby defining instances of the @Pinchable@ typeclass by hand, or with\nautomatically derived instances by using generics. Check the documentation\nin the \"Pinch\" module for more information.\n\n/What is Thrift?/: Apache Thrift provides an interface description\nlanguage, a set of communication protocols, and a code generator and\nlibraries for various programming languages to interact with the generated\ncode. Pinch aims to provide an alternative implementation of Thrift for\nHaskell.\n\nDocumentation is available on\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pinch Hackage> and\n<http://abhinavg.net/pinch/ here>.";
