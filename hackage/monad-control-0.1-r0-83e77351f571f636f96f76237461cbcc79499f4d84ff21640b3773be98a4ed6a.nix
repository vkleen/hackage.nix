Instances are based on monad transformers in\n@MonadTransControl@, which includes all standard monad transformers\nin the @transformers@ library except @ContT@.  For convenience, it\nprovides a wrapped version of @Control.Exception@ with types\ngeneralized from @IO@ to all monads in @MonadControlIO@.\n\nNote that this package is a rewrite of Anders Kaseorg's @monad-peel@ library.\nThe main difference is that this package provides CPS style\noperators and exploits the @RankNTypes@ language extension to\nsimplify most definitions.\n\nThe package includes a copy of the @monad-peel@ testsuite written by Anders Kaseorg.\nThe tests can be performed by using @cabal test@.\n\nThe following @critertion@ based benchmark shows that @monad-control@ is about\n2 times faster than @monad-peel@:\n\n<http://code.haskell.org/~basvandijk/code/bench-monad-peel-control>";
