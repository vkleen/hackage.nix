If\nyou need to be able to export, send a mail.\n\nNOTE This is rather fragile as some files use different index\nenumerations, which we handle rather... simplistically.\n\nIn principle, all parameters should be symmetric regarding the\nstem direction. However, there is one asymmetry case in\ndnastack.dh. We do not fix this problem as we do not change the\nsource files.";
