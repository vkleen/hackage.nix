See hinduce-examples for an example.\nhInduce is a framework for knowledge discovery/machine learning/data mining. It has a modular design that hopefully will invite others to re-use and build upon the interface. This module currently deviates from this concept, because we had a different focus and too limited time budget to investigate other rule mining algorithms and find any use for this kind of abstraction.";
