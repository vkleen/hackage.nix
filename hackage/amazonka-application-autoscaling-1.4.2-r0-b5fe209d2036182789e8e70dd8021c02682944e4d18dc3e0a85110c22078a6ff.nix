With Application Auto Scaling, you can\nautomatically scale your AWS resources, with an experience similar to\nthat of Auto Scaling.\nAt this time, Application Auto Scaling only supports scaling Amazon ECS\nservices.\nFor example, you can use Application Auto Scaling to accomplish the\nfollowing tasks:\n-   Define scaling policies for automatically adjusting your\napplication’s resources\n-   Scale your resources in response to CloudWatch alarms\n-   View history of your scaling events\n\nThe types from this library are intended to be used with\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka amazonka>, which provides\nmechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.\n\nUse of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.\nThis is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding\nde/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.\nThe provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries\nsuch as <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens lens> or\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core lens-family-core>.\n\nSee \"Network.AWS.ApplicationAutoScaling\" or <https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/ the AWS Documentation>\nto get started.";
