Also known as a\nbinary semaphore or mutex. The package additionally provides an\nalternative that works in the @STM@ monad.\n\n* @RLock@: A lock which can be acquired multiple times by the same\nthread. Also known as a reentrant mutex.\n\n* @ReadWriteLock@: Multiple-reader, single-writer locks. Used to\nprotect shared resources which may be concurrently read, but only\nsequentially written.\n\n* @ReadWriteVar@: Concurrent read, sequential write variables.\n\nPlease consult the API documentation of the individual modules for\nmore detailed information.\n\nThis package was inspired by the concurrency libraries of Java and\nPython.";
