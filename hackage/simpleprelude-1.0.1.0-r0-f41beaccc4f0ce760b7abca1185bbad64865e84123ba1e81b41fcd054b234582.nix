Instead it provides\nmonomorphically typed arithmetic operators on\nInteger.\n\nIt also provides two executables: simple-ghc and\nsimple-ghci which are wrappers around ghc and\nghci. They are pre-configured to use the Prelude\nmodule of this library instead of base's Prelude\nmodule.\n\nRelease History:\n\n- 1.0.1.0: Add a Haskell pre-processor to restore\nthe feel of an implicityly imported Prelude although\nwe use -XNoImplicitPrelude.";
