Swish is conceived\nas a toolkit for experimenting with RDF inference, and for\nimplementing stand-alone RDF file processors (usable in\nsimilar style to CWM, but with a view to being extensible\nin declarative style through added Haskell function and data\nvalue declarations). It explores Haskell as \"a scripting\nlanguage for the Semantic Web\".\nSwish is a work-in-progress, and currently incorporates:\n* Notation3 input and output.\n* RDF graph isomorphism testing and merging.\n* Display of differences between RDF graphs.\n* Inference operations in forward chaining, backward chaining and proof-checking modes.\n* Simple Horn-style rule implementations, extendable through variable binding modifiers and filters.\n* Class restriction rule implementation, primarily for datatype inferences.\n* RDF formal semantics entailment rule implementation.\n* Complete, ready-to-run, command-line and script-driven programs.\nReferences\n1) http://www.ninebynine.org/RDFNotes/Swish/Intro.html\n2) http://www.ninebynine.org/Software/swish-0.2.1.html";
