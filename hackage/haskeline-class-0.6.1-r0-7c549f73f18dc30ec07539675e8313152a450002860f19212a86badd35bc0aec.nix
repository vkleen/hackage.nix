Sadly, InputT defines ints own instance of the\nmtl MonadState, which is no good for folks wanting to use\nInputT in an existing monad transformer stack.\n\nHaskelineT also has an instance of MonadState, but it merely\nlifts the functions further in the transformer stack.\n\nLarge portions of the Haskeline functionality are re-exported\nhere for convinience.\n\nNote on build-dependencies: If you've succesfully built this with\nany packages other than the ones noted, please let me know.";
